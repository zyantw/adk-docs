# Parallel template workflow agent

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0TypeScript v0.2.0Go v0.1.0Java v0.2.0

The ***ParallelAgent*** class is a [template workflow](/agents/workflow-agents/) agent that executes its sub-agents concurrently. This execution strategy can dramatically speed up workflows where two or more tasks can be performed independently. For scenarios prioritizing speed and involving independent, resource-intensive tasks, this templated workflow facilitates parallel execution, which can significantly reduce overall processing time. When using this workflow type, it is important that each sub-agent can operate without depending on the other sub-agents. This workflow type is particularly beneficial for operations like multi-source data retrieval or heavy computations, where parallelization yields substantial performance gains.

As with other templated workflows, the execution of a ***ParallelAgent*** object is not controlled by an AI model, and is deterministic in how it executes its sub-agents. The sub-agents specified in the parallel execution set may or may not utilize AI models, but the overall execution of those sub-agents is ultimately managed by the ***ParallelAgent*** object you define.

Alternative: graph-based workflows

Starting in ADK 2.0 for Python and Go, templated workflows have been superseded

by more flexible workflow structures, including [graph-based workflows](/graphs/) and [dynamic workflows](/graphs/dynamic/).

### How it works

When the `ParallelAgent`'s `run_async()` method is called:

1. **Concurrent Execution:** It initiates the `run_async()` method of *each* sub-agent present in the `sub_agents` list *concurrently*. This means all the agents start running at (approximately) the same time.
1. **Independent Branches:** Each sub-agent operates in its own execution branch. There is ***no* automatic sharing of conversation history or state between these branches** during execution.
1. **Result Collection:** The `ParallelAgent` manages the parallel execution and, typically, provides a way to access the results from each sub-agent after they have completed (e.g., through a list of results or events). The order of results may not be deterministic.

### Independent Execution and State Management

It's *crucial* to understand that sub-agents within a `ParallelAgent` run independently. If you *need* communication or data sharing between these agents, you must implement it explicitly. Possible approaches include:

- **Shared `InvocationContext`:** You could pass a shared `InvocationContext` object to each sub-agent. This object could act as a shared data store. However, you'd need to manage concurrent access to this shared context carefully (e.g., using locks) to avoid race conditions.
- **External State Management:** Use an external database, message queue, or other mechanism to manage shared state and facilitate communication between agents.
- **Post-Processing:** Collect results from each branch, and then implement logic to coordinate data afterwards.

### Full Example: Parallel Web Research

Imagine researching multiple topics simultaneously:

1. **Researcher Agent 1:** An `LlmAgent` that researches "renewable energy sources."

1. **Researcher Agent 2:** An `LlmAgent` that researches "electric vehicle technology."

1. **Researcher Agent 3:** An `LlmAgent` that researches "carbon capture methods."

   ```py
   ParallelAgent(sub_agents=[ResearcherAgent1, ResearcherAgent2, ResearcherAgent3])
   ```

These research tasks are independent. Using a `ParallelAgent` allows them to run concurrently, potentially reducing the total research time significantly compared to running them sequentially. The results from each agent would be collected separately after they finish.
