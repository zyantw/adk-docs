# vLLM model host for ADK agents

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0

Tools such as [vLLM](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm) allow you to host models efficiently and serve them as an OpenAI-compatible API endpoint. You can use vLLM models through the [LiteLLM](/agents/models/litellm/) library for Python.

## Setup

1. **Deploy Model:** Deploy your chosen model using vLLM (or a similar tool). Note the API base URL (e.g., `https://your-vllm-endpoint.run.app/v1`).
   - *Important for ADK Tools:* When deploying, ensure the serving tool supports and enables OpenAI-compatible tool/function calling. For vLLM, this might involve flags like `--enable-auto-tool-choice` and potentially a specific `--tool-call-parser`, depending on the model. Refer to the vLLM documentation on Tool Use.
1. **Authentication:** Determine how your endpoint handles authentication (e.g., API key, bearer token).

## Integration Example

The following example shows how to use a vLLM endpoint with ADK agents.

```python
import subprocess
from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.models.lite_llm import LiteLlm

# --- Example Agent using a Gemma 4 model hosted on a vLLM endpoint ---

# Endpoint URL provided by your vLLM deployment
api_base_url = "https://your-vllm-endpoint.run.app/v1"

# Model name as recognized by *your* vLLM endpoint configuration
model_name_at_endpoint = "hosted_vllm/google/gemma-4-E4B-it" # Example from vllm_test.py

# Authentication (Example: using gcloud identity token for a Cloud Run deployment)
# Adapt this based on your endpoint's security
try:
    gcloud_token = subprocess.check_output(
        ["gcloud", "auth", "print-identity-token", "-q"]
    ).decode().strip()
    auth_headers = {"Authorization": f"Bearer {gcloud_token}"}
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Warning: Could not get gcloud token - {e}. Endpoint might be unsecured or require different auth.")
    auth_headers = None # Or handle error appropriately

agent_vllm = LlmAgent(
    model=LiteLlm(
        model=model_name_at_endpoint,
        api_base=api_base_url,
        # This extra_body values specific to Gemma 4.
        extra_body={
            "chat_template_kwargs": {
                "enable_thinking": True # Enable thinking
            },
            "skip_special_tokens": False # Should be set to False
        },
        # Pass authentication headers if needed
        extra_headers=auth_headers,
        # Alternatively, if endpoint uses an API key:
        # api_key="YOUR_ENDPOINT_API_KEY"
    ),
    name="vllm_agent",
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant running on a self-hosted vLLM endpoint.",
    # ... other agent parameters
)
```
