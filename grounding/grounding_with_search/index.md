# Grounding with Search for agents

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0Java v0.1.0Kotlin v0.2.0

[Agent Search](/integrations/agent-search/) is a powerful tool for the Agent Development Kit (ADK) that enables AI agents to access information from your private enterprise documents and data repositories. By connecting your agents to indexed enterprise content, you can provide users with answers grounded in your organization's knowledge base.

This feature is particularly valuable for enterprise-specific queries requiring information from internal documentation, policies, research papers, or any proprietary content that has been indexed in your [Agent Search](https://cloud.google.com/enterprise-search) datastore. When your agent determines that information from your knowledge base is needed, it automatically searches your indexed documents and incorporates the results into its response with proper attribution.

## Preparing Agent Search

Before creating a grounded agent, you must have an existing Agent Search Data Store. If you don't have one, follow the instructions in [Get started with custom search](https://cloud.google.com/generative-ai-app-builder/docs/try-enterprise-search#unstructured-data) to create one. You will need your `Data store ID` (e.g., `projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/YOUR_DATASTORE_ID`) to configure the agent.

## Authentication Setup

Agent Search requires your ADK agent to be connected to a Google Cloud project authentication. You can not use a Gemini API Key from Google AI Studio when using this tool. For more information on connecting your ADK agent to Google Cloud projects, see the [Connect to Google Cloud](/get-started/google-cloud/) guide.

- Set up the [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/start/quickstarts/quickstart-multimodal#setup-local)
- Authenticate to Google Cloud, from the terminal by running `gcloud auth login`.
- For Python, open the **`.env`** file and specify your project ID and location.
- For Java and Kotlin, ensure your application environment has Google Cloud default credentials configured (`GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS`), and set the variables below in that same environment rather than in a `.env` file.

.env

```text
GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE=TRUE
GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=YOUR_PROJECT_ID
GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=LOCATION
```

For more information on connecting to Google Cloud from ADK agents, see [Connect to Google Cloud and Agent Platform](/get-started/google-cloud/).

## Creating a Grounded Agent

To enable Grounding with Search, you include the search tool in your agent definition, providing the `data_store_id`.

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools import VertexAiSearchTool

# Configuration
DATASTORE_ID = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/YOUR_DATASTORE_ID"

root_agent = Agent(
    name="vertex_search_agent",
    model="gemini-flash-latest",
    instruction="Answer questions using Agent Search to find information from internal documents. Always cite sources when available.",
    description="Enterprise document search assistant with Agent Search capabilities",
    tools=[VertexAiSearchTool(data_store_id=DATASTORE_ID)]
)
```

```java
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.tools.VertexAiSearchTool;

// Configuration
String DATASTORE_ID = "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/YOUR_DATASTORE_ID";

LlmAgent rootAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
    .name("vertex_search_agent")
    .model("gemini-flash-latest")
    .instruction("Answer questions using Agent Search to find information from internal documents. Always cite sources when available.")
    .description("Enterprise document search assistant with Agent Search capabilities")
    .tools(VertexAiSearchTool.builder().dataStoreId(DATASTORE_ID).build())
    .build();
```

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.agents.Instruction
import com.google.adk.kt.agents.LlmAgent
import com.google.adk.kt.models.Gemini
import com.google.adk.kt.tools.VertexAiSearchTool

// Configuration
val DATASTORE_ID =
    "projects/YOUR_PROJECT_ID/locations/global/collections/default_collection/dataStores/YOUR_DATASTORE_ID"

val rootAgent =
    LlmAgent(
        name = "vertex_search_agent",
        model = Gemini(name = "gemini-flash-latest"),
        instruction =
            Instruction(
                "Answer questions using Agent Search to find information from internal " +
                    "documents. Always cite sources when available.",
            ),
        description = "Enterprise document search assistant with Agent Search capabilities",
        tools = listOf(VertexAiSearchTool(dataStoreId = DATASTORE_ID)),
    )
```

## How Grounding with Search works

Grounding with Search is the process that connects your agent to your organization's indexed documents and data, allowing it to generate accurate responses based on private enterprise content. When a user's prompt requires information from your internal knowledge base, the agent's underlying LLM intelligently decides to invoke the `VertexAiSearchTool` to find relevant facts from your indexed documents.

### Data Flow Diagram

This diagram illustrates the step-by-step process of how a user query results in a grounded response.

### Detailed Description

The grounding agent uses the data flow described in the diagram to retrieve, process, and incorporate enterprise information into the final answer presented to the user.

1. **User Query**: An end-user interacts with your agent by asking a question about internal documents or enterprise data.
1. **ADK Orchestration**: The Agent Development Kit orchestrates the agent's behavior and passes the user's message to the core of your agent.
1. **LLM Analysis and Tool-Calling**: The agent's LLM (e.g., a Gemini model) analyzes the prompt. If it determines that information from your indexed documents is required, it triggers the grounding mechanism by calling the `VertexAiSearchTool`. This is ideal for answering queries about company policies, technical documentation, or proprietary research.
1. **Vertex AI Search Service Interaction**: The `VertexAiSearchTool` interacts with your configured Agent Search datastore, which contains your indexed enterprise documents. The service formulates and executes search queries against your private content.
1. **Document Retrieval & Ranking**: Agent Search retrieves and ranks the most relevant document chunks from your datastore based on semantic similarity and relevance scoring.
1. **Context Injection**: The search service integrates the retrieved document snippets into the model's context before the final response is generated. This crucial step allows the model to "reason" over your organization's factual data.
1. **Grounded Response Generation**: The LLM, now informed by relevant enterprise content, generates a response that incorporates the retrieved information from your documents.
1. **Response Presentation with Sources**: The ADK receives the final grounded response, which includes the necessary source document references and `groundingMetadata`, and presents it to the user with attribution. This allows end-users to verify the information against your enterprise sources.

## Understanding Grounding with Search response

When the agent uses Agent Search to ground a response, it returns detailed information that includes the final text answer and metadata about the documents used to generate that answer. This metadata is crucial for verifying the response and providing attribution to your enterprise sources.

### Example of a Grounded Response

The following is an example of the content object returned by the model after a grounded query against enterprise documents.

**Final Answer Text:**

```text
"Developing models for a medical scribe presents several significant challenges, primarily due to the complex nature of medical documentation, the sensitive data involved, and the demanding requirements of clinical workflows. Key challenges include: **Accuracy and Reliability:** Medical documentation requires extremely high levels of accuracy, as errors can lead to misdiagnoses, incorrect treatments, and legal repercussions. Ensuring that AI models can reliably capture nuanced medical language, distinguish between subjective and objective information, and accurately transcribe physician-patient interactions is a major hurdle. **Natural Language Understanding (NLU) and Speech Recognition:** Medical conversations are often rapid, involve highly specialized jargon, acronyms, and abbreviations, and can be spoken by individuals with diverse accents or speech patterns... [response continues with detailed analysis of privacy, integration, and technical challenges]"
```

  }
}
```

### How to Interpret the Response

The metadata provides a link between the text generated by the model and the enterprise documents that support it. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

- **groundingChunks**: This is a list of the enterprise documents the model consulted. Each chunk retrieved from your datastore carries a `retrievedContext` object holding the document `title`, its `uri`, the `documentName` (the full Agent Search resource name of the document), and the `text` that was retrieved.
- **groundingSupports**: This list connects specific sentences in the final answer back to the `groundingChunks`.
- **segment**: This object identifies a specific portion of the final text answer, defined by its `startIndex`, `endIndex`, and the `text` itself.
- **groundingChunkIndices**: This array contains the index numbers that correspond to the sources listed in the `groundingChunks`. For example, the text about "HIPAA compliance" is supported by information from `groundingChunks` at index 1 (the "Regulatory and Ethical Hurdles" document).
- **retrievalQueries**: This array shows the specific search queries that were executed against your datastore to find relevant information.

## How to display responses with Grounding with Search

Unlike Google Search grounding, Grounding with Search does not require specific display components. However, displaying citations and document references builds trust and allows users to verify information against your organization's authoritative sources.

### Optional Citation Display

Since grounding metadata is provided, you can choose to implement citation displays based on your application needs:

**Simple Text Display (Minimal Implementation):**

```python
for event in events:
    if event.is_final_response() and event.content and event.content.parts:
        print(event.content.parts[0].text)

        # Optional: Show source count
        if event.grounding_metadata and event.grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks:
            print(f"\nBased on {len(event.grounding_metadata.grounding_chunks)} documents")
```

```java
for (Event event : events) {
    if (event.finalResponse()) {
        System.out.println(event.content().parts().get(0).text());

        // Optional: Show source count
        if (event.groundingMetadata().isPresent()) {
            System.out.println("\nBased on " + event.groundingMetadata().get().groundingChunks().size() + " documents");
        }
    }
}
```

```kotlin
events.collect { event ->
    if (event.isFinalResponse) {
        println(event.content?.parts?.firstOrNull()?.text)

        // Optional: Show source count
        val chunks = event.groundingMetadata?.groundingChunks
        if (!chunks.isNullOrEmpty()) {
            println("\nBased on ${chunks.size} documents")
        }
    }
}
```

**Enhanced Citation Display (Optional):** You can implement interactive citations that show which documents support each statement. The grounding metadata provides all necessary information to map text segments to source documents.

### Implementation Considerations

When implementing Grounding with Search displays:

1. **Document Access**: Verify user permissions for referenced documents
1. **Simple Integration**: Basic text output requires no additional display logic
1. **Optional Enhancements**: Add citations only if your use case benefits from source attribution
1. **Document Links**: Convert document URIs to accessible internal links when needed
1. **Search Queries**: The `retrievalQueries` array shows what searches were performed against your datastore
