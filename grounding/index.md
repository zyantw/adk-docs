# Grounding agents with data

Grounding is the process that connects your AI agents to external information sources, allowing them to generate more accurate, current, and verifiable responses. By grounding agent responses in authoritative data, you can reduce hallucinations and provide users with answers backed by reliable sources.

ADK supports multiple grounding approaches:

- **Google Search Grounding**: Connect agents to real-time web information for queries requiring current data like news, weather, or facts that may have changed since the model's training.

- **Grounding with Search**: Connect agents to your organization's private documents and enterprise data for queries requiring proprietary information.

- **Agentic RAG**: Build agents that reason about how to search, constructing queries and filters dynamically using Agent Retrieval, Knowledge Engine, or other retrieval systems.

- **Google Search Grounding**
