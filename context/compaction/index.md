# Compress agent context for performance

Supported in ADKPython v1.16.0Java v0.2.0TypeScript v0.6.0Kotlin v0.7.0

As an ADK agent runs it collects *context* information, including user instructions, retrieved data, tool responses, and generated content. As the size of this context data grows, agent processing times typically also increase. More and more data is sent to the generative AI model used by the agent, increasing processing time and slowing down responses. ADK Context Compaction feature is designed to reduce the size of context as an agent is running by summarizing older session history—including instructions, inputs, and model responses. By maintaining a compact context window, this process **optimizes latency and reduces costs** while ensuring the agent retains access to essential recent interactions.

Compaction is integrated directly into SingleFlow via the `CompactionRequestProcessor`, allowing automatic event compaction based on the rules you set in the `EventsCompactionConfig`.

## Choose your strategy

You can manage your session's data using the following strategies within `EventsCompactionConfig`:

- **Token-Based (Primary)**: Triggers cleanup based on the actual volume of tokens consumed. This acts as an absolute safety net and is ideal for unpredictable workloads, like when users paste massive code blocks or upload large files.
- **Sliding Window (Turn-Based)**: Triggers cleanup after a fixed number of conversational turns. This is useful for regular, predictable text chats.

If you configure both compaction strategies, the system prioritizes token-based compaction. When the session length exceeds your defined token threshold, the system triggers token-based compaction and skips sliding-window compaction for that turn.

## Token-based compaction

Token-based compaction triggers context management based on the volume of tokens or data, rather than the number of events or turns.

### Configuration settings

Add token-based compaction to your agent workflow by adding an `EventsCompactionConfig` setting to the App object. You must specify the following:

- **`token_threshold`**: The safety limit of tokens that automatically triggers tail-retention compaction once reached.
- **`event_retention_size`**: The number of recent events/interactions kept in "raw" un-compacted format when compaction is triggered. This maintains immediate conversational context and pronoun resolution.

To implement this in your project, use the following configuration:

```python
# 1. Correct the import path to use the google.adk namespace
from google.adk.apps.app import App, EventsCompactionConfig
from google.adk.agents import Agent

# 2. Initialize your root agent (required for App setup)
root_agent = Agent(
    name="my_root_agent",
    description="Main coordinating agent for the workflow."
)

# 3. Token-based configuration: Activates the priority/pre-call layer
compaction_config = EventsCompactionConfig(
    token_threshold=4000,     # Triggers compaction when actual token count exceeds this
    event_retention_size=5    # Number of recent raw events to keep intact when token limit is hit
)

# 4. Register with required name and root_agent fields, and the config object
app = App(
    name="my_compacting_agent_app",
    root_agent=root_agent,
    events_compaction_config=compaction_config
)
```

## Sliding window compaction

The Context Compaction feature uses a *sliding window* approach for collecting and summarizing agent workflow event data within a [Session](/sessions/session/). When you configure this feature in your agent, it summarizes data from older events once it reaches a threshold of a specific number of workflow events, or invocations, with the current Session.

```python
# (Optional) Event-based, sliding window as supplementary setting
compaction_config = EventsCompactionConfig(
    compaction_interval=10,   # Number of turns between standard compactions
    overlap_size=2,           # Number of events to retain as overlapping context
```

## Configure context compaction

Add context compaction to your agent workflow by adding an Events Compaction Configuration setting to the App object (Python/Java/Kotlin) or by configuring `contextCompactors` on the `LlmAgent` (TypeScript). As part of the configuration, you must specify a compaction interval and overlap size (Python/Java) or a token threshold and event retention size (TypeScript/Kotlin), as shown in the following sample code:

```python
from google.adk.apps.app import App
from google.adk.apps.app import EventsCompactionConfig

app = App(
    name='my-agent',
    root_agent=root_agent,
    events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
        compaction_interval=3,  # Trigger compaction every 3 new invocations.
        overlap_size=1          # Include last invocation from the previous window.
    ),
)
```

```java
import com.google.adk.apps.App;
import com.google.adk.summarizer.EventsCompactionConfig;

App app = App.builder()
    .name("my-agent")
    .rootAgent(rootAgent)
    .eventsCompactionConfig(EventsCompactionConfig.builder()
        .compactionInterval(3)  // Trigger compaction every 3 new invocations.
        .overlapSize(1)         // Include last invocation from the previous window.
        .build())
    .build();
```

```typescript
import {Gemini, LlmAgent, LlmSummarizer, TokenBasedContextCompactor} from '@google/adk';

const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'my-agent',
  model: 'gemini-flash-latest',
  contextCompactors: [
    new TokenBasedContextCompactor({
      tokenThreshold: 1000, // Trigger compaction when session exceeds 1000 tokens.
      eventRetentionSize: 1, // Keep at least 1 raw event (overlap).
      summarizer: new LlmSummarizer({
        llm: new Gemini({model: 'gemini-flash-latest'}),
      }),
    }),
  ],
});
```

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.apps.App
import com.google.adk.kt.summarizer.EventsCompactionConfig

// tokenThreshold and eventRetentionSize must be set together; either alone throws.
// Kotlin also accepts the compactionInterval/overlapSize pair used in the other tabs.
val app =
    App(
        appName = "my-agent",
        rootAgent = rootAgent,
        eventsCompactionConfig =
            EventsCompactionConfig(
                tokenThreshold = 1000, // Compact when the last prompt exceeds 1000 tokens.
                eventRetentionSize = 1, // Keep at least 1 raw event.
            ),
    )
```

Once configured, the ADK `Runner` handles the compaction process in the background each time the session reaches the interval.

## Example of context compaction

If you set `compaction_interval` to 3 and `overlap_size` to 1, the event data is compressed upon completion of events 3, 6, 9, and so on. The overlap setting increases size of the second summary compression, and each summary afterwards, as shown in Figure 1.

**Figure 1.** Illustration of event compaction configuration with an interval of 3 and overlap of 1.

With this example configuration, the context compression tasks happen as follows:

1. **Event 3 completes**: All 3 events are compressed into a summary
1. **Event 6 completes**: Events 3 to 6 are compressed, including the overlap of 1 prior event
1. **Event 9 completes**: Events 6 to 9 are compressed, including the overlap of 1 prior event

## Configuration settings

The configuration settings for this feature control how frequently event data is compressed and how much data is retained as the agent workflow runs. Optionally, you can configure a compactor object

- **`compaction_interval`**: Set the number of completed events that triggers compaction of the prior event data.
- **`overlap_size`**: Set how many of the previously compacted events are included in a newly compacted context set.
- **`summarizer`**: (Optional) Define a summarizer object including a specific AI model to use for summarization. For more information, see [Define a Summarizer](#define-summarizer).

### Define a Summarizer

You can customize the process of context compression by defining a summarizer. The `LlmEventSummarizer` (Python, Java and Kotlin) or `LlmSummarizer` (TypeScript) class allows you to specify a particular model for summarization. The following code example demonstrates how to define and configure a custom summarizer:

```python
from google.adk.apps.app import App, EventsCompactionConfig
from google.adk.apps.llm_event_summarizer import LlmEventSummarizer
from google.adk.models import Gemini

# Define the AI model to be used for summarization:
summarization_llm = Gemini(model="gemini-flash-latest")

# Create the summarizer with the custom model:
my_summarizer = LlmEventSummarizer(llm=summarization_llm)

# Configure the App with the custom summarizer and compaction settings:
app = App(
    name='my-agent',
    root_agent=root_agent,
    events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
        compaction_interval=3,
        overlap_size=1,
        summarizer=my_summarizer,
    ),
)
```

```java
import com.google.adk.apps.App;
import com.google.adk.models.Gemini;
import com.google.adk.summarizer.EventsCompactionConfig;
import com.google.adk.summarizer.LlmEventSummarizer;

// Define the AI model to be used for summarization:
Gemini summarizationLlm = Gemini.builder()
    .model("gemini-flash-latest")
    .build();

// Create the summarizer with the custom model:
LlmEventSummarizer mySummarizer = new LlmEventSummarizer(summarizationLlm);

// Configure the App with the custom summarizer and compaction settings:
App app = App.builder()
    .name("my-agent")
    .rootAgent(rootAgent)
    .eventsCompactionConfig(EventsCompactionConfig.builder()
        .compactionInterval(3)
        .overlapSize(1)
        .summarizer(mySummarizer)
        .build())
    .build();
```

```typescript
import {Gemini, LlmAgent, LlmSummarizer, TokenBasedContextCompactor} from '@google/adk';

// Define the AI model to be used for summarization:
const summarizationLlm = new Gemini({model: 'gemini-flash-latest'});

// Create the summarizer with the custom model:
const mySummarizer = new LlmSummarizer({llm: summarizationLlm});

// Configure the agent with the custom summarizer and compaction settings:
const agent = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'my-agent',
  model: 'gemini-flash-latest',
  contextCompactors: [
    new TokenBasedContextCompactor({
      tokenThreshold: 1000,
      eventRetentionSize: 1,
      summarizer: mySummarizer,
    }),
  ],
});
```

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.apps.App
import com.google.adk.kt.models.Gemini
import com.google.adk.kt.summarizer.EventsCompactionConfig
import com.google.adk.kt.summarizer.LlmEventSummarizer

// Define the AI model to be used for summarization:
val summarizationLlm = Gemini(name = "gemini-flash-latest")

// Create the summarizer with the custom model:
val mySummarizer = LlmEventSummarizer(model = summarizationLlm)

// Configure the App with the custom summarizer and compaction settings:
val app =
    App(
        appName = "my-agent",
        rootAgent = rootAgent,
        eventsCompactionConfig =
            EventsCompactionConfig(
                compactionInterval = 3,
                overlapSize = 1,
                summarizer = mySummarizer,
            ),
    )
```

You can further refine the compactor by modifying its summarizer. In Python, Java and Kotlin, customize the prompt template on `LlmEventSummarizer` — the property is `prompt_template` in Python, and `promptTemplate` in Java and Kotlin. In TypeScript, customize the `prompt` on `LlmSummarizer`. For more details, see the [`LlmEventSummarizer` code](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/apps/llm_event_summarizer.py#L60) or [`LlmSummarizer` code](https://github.com/google/adk-js/blob/main/core/src/context/summarizers/llm_summarizer.ts).
