# App workflow management class

Supported in ADKPython v1.14.0Java v0.1.0

The ***App*** class is a top-level container for an entire Agent Development Kit (ADK) agent workflow. It is designed to manage the lifecycle, configuration, and state for a collection of agents grouped by a ***root agent***. The **App** class separates the concerns of an agent workflow's overall operational infrastructure from individual agents' task-oriented reasoning.

Defining an ***App*** object in your ADK workflow is optional and changes how you organize your agent code and run your agents. From a practical perspective, you use the ***App*** class to configure the following features for your agent workflow:

- [**Context caching**](/context/caching/)
- [**Context compression**](/context/compaction/)
- [**Agent resume**](/runtime/resume/)
- [**Plugins**](/plugins/)

This guide explains how to use the App class for configuring and managing your ADK agent workflows.

## Purpose of App Class

The ***App*** class addresses several architectural issues that arise when building complex agentic systems:

- **Centralized configuration:** Provides a single, centralized location for managing shared resources like API keys and database clients, avoiding the need to pass configuration down through every agent.
- **Lifecycle management:** The ***App*** class includes ***on startup*** and ***on shutdown*** hooks, which allow for reliable management of persistent resources such as database connection pools or in-memory caches that need to exist across multiple invocations.
- **State scope:** It defines an explicit boundary for application-level state with an `app:*` prefix making the scope and lifetime of this state clear to developers.
- **Unit of deployment:** The ***App*** concept establishes a formal *deployable unit*, simplifying versioning, testing, and serving of agentic applications.

## Define an App object

The ***App*** class is used as the primary container of your agent workflow and contains the root agent of the project. The ***root agent*** is the container for the primary controller agent and any additional sub-agents.

### Define app with root agent

Create a ***root agent*** for your workflow by creating an instance of the ***Agent*** class. Then define an ***App*** object and configure it with the ***root agent*** object and optional features, as shown in the following sample code:

agent.py

```python
from google.adk.agents.llm_agent import Agent
from google.adk.apps import App

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-flash-latest',
    name='greeter_agent',
    description='An agent that provides a friendly greeting.',
    instruction='Reply with Hello, World!',
)

app = App(
    name="agents",
    root_agent=root_agent,
    # Optionally include App-level features:
    # plugins, context_cache_config, events_compaction_config,
    # resumability_config
)
```

AgentConfiguration.java

```java
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.apps.App;

LlmAgent rootAgent = LlmAgent.builder()
    .model("gemini-flash-latest")
    .name("greeter_agent")
    .description("An agent that provides a friendly greeting.")
    .instruction("Reply with Hello, World!")
    .build();

App app = App.builder()
    .name("agents")
    .rootAgent(rootAgent)
    // Optionally include App-level features:
    // .plugins(plugins)
    // .contextCacheConfig(contextCacheConfig)
    // .eventsCompactionConfig(eventsCompactionConfig)
    .build();
```

Recommended: Use `app` variable name

In your agent project code, set your ***App*** object to the variable name `app` so it is compatible with the ADK command line interface runner tools.

### Run your App agent

You can use the ***Runner*** class to run your agent workflow using the `app` parameter, as shown in the following code sample:

main.py

```python
import asyncio
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
from agent import app # import code from agent.py

load_dotenv() # load API keys and settings
# Set a Runner using the imported application object
runner = InMemoryRunner(app=app)

async def main():
    try:  # run_debug() requires ADK Python 1.18 or higher:
        response = await runner.run_debug("Hello there!")

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred during agent execution: {e}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

AppMain.java

```java
import com.google.adk.agents.Content;
import com.google.adk.runner.Runner;

public class AppMain {

  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    // Set a Runner using the application object

    App app = ...;

    Runner runner = Runner.builder()
        .app(app) // Use the 'app' object defined previously
        .build();

    runner.runAsync("user", "session-1", Content.fromParts(Part.fromText("Hello there!")))
        .filter(event -> event.finalResponse() && event.content().isPresent())
        .blockingSubscribe(event -> System.out.println("Response: " + event.stringifyContent()));
  }
}
```

Version requirement for `Runner.run_debug()`

The `Runner.run_debug()` command requires ADK Python v1.18.0 or higher. You can also use `Runner.run()`, which requires more setup code. For more details, see the [Agent Runtime](/runtime/) guide.

Run your App agent with the `main.py` code using the following command:

```console
python3 main.py
```

Run your App agent with the `AppMain.java` code using your build tool (e.g. Gradle `application` plugin):

```console
./gradlew run
```
