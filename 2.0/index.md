## ADK Python 1.x compatibility

ADK 2.0 is designed to be compatible with agents developed with ADK 1.x releases. However, there are a few breaking changes you should be aware of before upgrading an ADK 1.x project to ADK 2.0.

Breaking changes: ADK Python 1.x to 2.0 incompatibilities

There are several known incompatibilities and breaking changes introduced with ADK Python v2.0.0. Before upgrading, review these changes and take mitigation steps, if necessary.

The ADK 2.0 release introduces the Workflow Runtime, transitioning ADK from a hierarchical agent executor to a graph-based execution engine. In this new architecture, your Agents, Tools, and Functions are evaluated as individual *nodes* within a workflow graph. If you are upgrading from ADK 1.x, review the following breaking changes and migration steps to ensure a smooth transition for your production applications.

### Event Schema & Custom Session Storage

ADK 2.0 introduces new fields `node_info` and `output` to the core ***Event*** schema to track graph state and workflow outputs.

- **Custom Session storage:** If you have implemented a custom `BaseSessionService`, such as storing sessions in your own SQL or NoSQL databases using rigid columns, your underlying database schema must be updated to accommodate these new fields. Inserting a 2.0 ***Event*** into a rigid 1.x database table causes insertion or ORM deserialization failures. *However, if your custom session service stores events as serialized JSON blobs rather than mapping them to explicit columns, you do not need to update your schema.*
- **Strict JSON validation:** If your deployment includes downstream API gateways, mobile clients, or web frontends that perform strict JSON schema validation, including setting `additionalProperties: false`, then validation will reject 2.0 events until their expected schemas are updated.

**Migration action:** Update your database schemas and downstream client validators to expect and store the `node_info` and `output` fields on all Event payloads. Ensure all reader applications are updated to handle the 2.0 format before writing 2.0 sessions to a shared database.

### Agent Execution: BaseAgent to BaseNode

In ADK 1.x, Agents were standalone executors. In ADK 2.0, the ***BaseAgent*** class now subclasses ***BaseNode***. Agents are now evaluated as individual *nodes* within the new Workflow Graph engine.

- **Execution driver custom overrides:** The ABC contract has changed. Custom overrides of 1.x abstract methods, such as `_run_async_impl()` or `generate_content()`, are no longer the correct way to drive execution. The Workflow Graph engine completely bypasses these legacy overrides. If you inject custom telemetry or state management by overriding these methods, those calls are silently ignored.

**Migration action:** Move custom execution logic out of `run()` overrides. Instead, utilize the standardized `BeforeAgentCallback` and `AfterAgentCallback` interfaces to safely inject custom logic into the execution lifecycle.

### Context & Callbacks: In-Place Mutation

Bypassing the framework to manually append events is no longer safe.

- **Direct appending of events:** In ADK 1.x, some developers forcefully appended events to the session via `context.session.events.append(custom_event)`. In ADK 2.0, the Workflow runner needs strict control over event emission to manage state, graph routing, and streaming. Manually appending to the session list circumvents the graph engine and breaks determinism.

**Migration action:** Do not append events directly to the session, and do not use `enqueue_event` directly. You must now explicitly yield the event from within your node or agent so that the framework can manage its persistence, routing, and streaming natively.

### Error Handling & Automatic Retries

The ADK 2.0 framework now automatically catches exceptions to enable automatic retries, telemetry, and Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) pauses.

- **`Try...except` and `BaseException`:** In ADK 1.x, the framework did not have native automatic retries, so developers often wrote manual `try...except` loops inside their tools to prevent crashes. In ADK 2.0, if you migrate a tool and leave a broad `except Exception:` block inside it, this code masks the failure from the framework, permanently disabling the new 2.0 automatic retry mechanisms for that step. Furthermore, catching `BaseException` inadvertently traps `NodeInterruptedError`, which breaks the framework's ability to pause the workflow for Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) input.

**Migration Action:** Allow standard exceptions to propagate out of your tools so the framework can evaluate them against your configured ***RetryConfig***, such as `RetryConfig(max_attempts=3)`. Never catch ***BaseException*** unless you are explicitly re-raising the exception.

If you encounter additional ADK Python 1.0 to ADK 2.0 incompatibilities, report them through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=v2).

### Installing ADK Python 1.x

If you want to update ADK, but are not yet ready to update to ADK 2.0, make sure to specify an ADK version during installation or use the compatible release `~=` operator as shown below. ADK 1.0 has the following system requirements:

- **Python 3.10** or later
- `pip` for installing packages

To install the latest version of ADK 1.x, follow these steps:

1. Enable a Python virtual environment. See below for instructions.

1. Install the package using pip using compatible release `~=` operator for ADK 1.x:

   ```bash
   pip install "google-adk~=1.0"
   ```

Recommended: Create and activate a Python virtual environment

Create a Python virtual environment:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the Python virtual environment:

```console
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

```console
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

## ADK TypeScript 1.x compatibility

ADK TypeScript 2.0 is designed to be compatible with agents developed with ADK TypeScript 1.x releases. However, there are a few breaking changes you should be aware of before upgrading an ADK TypeScript 1.x project to ADK TypeScript 2.0.

Breaking changes: ADK TypeScript 1.x to 2.0 incompatibilities

There are several known incompatibilities and breaking changes introduced with ADK TypeScript v2.0.0. Before upgrading, review these changes and take mitigation steps, if necessary.

The ADK TypeScript 2.0 release introduces the Workflow Runtime, transitioning ADK TypeScript from a hierarchical agent executor to a graph-based execution engine. In this new architecture, your Agents, Tools, and Functions are evaluated as individual *nodes* within a workflow graph. If you are upgrading from ADK TypeScript 1.x, review the following breaking changes and migration steps.

### Event Schema & Custom Session Storage

ADK TypeScript 2.0 adds four optional fields to the core ***Event*** interface to support graph routing, workflow output, and multi-agent isolation:

| Field            | Type       | Purpose                                                                               |
| ---------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `output`         | `unknown`  | The structured output produced by the emitting node.                                  |
| `route`          | `Route`    | The route keys emitted by a routing node, used to select the matching outgoing edges. |
| `nodeInfo`       | `NodeInfo` | Workflow-node metadata identifying which node emitted the event.                      |
| `isolationScope` | `string`   | Restricts which agent contexts see this event in LLM prompt history.                  |

All four fields are optional, and each serializes under the name shown above.

- **Custom session storage:** If you have implemented a custom session service, such as one storing sessions in your own SQL or NoSQL database with a rigid schema, your underlying database schema must be updated to accommodate the four new fields. Inserting a 2.0 ***Event*** into a rigid 1.x database table causes insertion or deserialization failures. *However, if your custom session service stores events as serialized JSON, you do not need to update your schema.*

**Migration action:** Update your database schemas and downstream client validators to expect and store the four new fields on all Event payloads.

### Agent Execution: BaseAgent extends BaseNode

In ADK TypeScript 1.x, `BaseAgent` was a standalone class. In ADK TypeScript 2.0, `BaseAgent` extends `BaseNode` so that every agent can run as a node in a workflow graph. Subclasses now inherit the `rerunOnResume`, `waitForOutput`, `retryConfig`, `timeout`, `inputSchema`, `outputSchema`, and `stateSchema` members.

- **Member name collisions:** A subclass that declares its own field using one of these names now collides with the inherited member and fails to compile.
- **`description` default value:** The `description` member is now typed `string` and defaults to an empty string. In ADK TypeScript 1.x it was `undefined` when unset, so a check such as `agent.description === undefined` no longer matches.

**Migration action:** Rename any subclass field that collides with an inherited member. Replace checks for an `undefined` description with a check for an empty string.

### Context: `InvocationContext.agent` is optional

A workflow node can run without an enclosing agent, so the `agent` property of `InvocationContext` changed from `BaseAgent` to `BaseAgent | undefined`. Code that reads this property without handling `undefined` no longer compiles under `strict` mode.

```typescript
// Before (ADK TypeScript 1.x)
const name = ctx.agent.name;

// After (ADK TypeScript 2.0), inside an agent's own execution
const name = requireAgent(ctx).name;

// After (ADK TypeScript 2.0), outside an agent's own execution
const name = ctx.agent?.name;
```

**Migration action:** Inside an agent's own execution, call `requireAgent(ctx)`, which returns the agent or throws an error that explains the invocation is running a node directly. Everywhere else, handle the `undefined` case.

### Deprecated: SequentialAgent, ParallelAgent, and LoopAgent

Constructing a `SequentialAgent`, `ParallelAgent`, or `LoopAgent` now logs a deprecation warning once per class, per process. These classes are otherwise unchanged and continue to work in ADK TypeScript 2.0.

**Migration action:** No immediate action is required. To stop the warning and gain more control over routing, express the same sequence, fan-out, or loop as a [graph workflow](/graphs/).

If you encounter additional ADK TypeScript 1.x to ADK 2.0 incompatibilities, report them through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/adk-js/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=v2).

### Installing ADK TypeScript 1.x

If you want to continue using ADK TypeScript 1.x and are not yet ready to upgrade to ADK TypeScript 2.0, pin your dependency to the 1.x release line:

```shell
npm install @google/adk@^1.6.0
```

## ADK Go 1.x compatibility

ADK Go 2.0 is designed to be compatible with agents developed with ADK Go 1.x releases. However, there are a few breaking changes you should be aware of before upgrading an ADK Go 1.x project to ADK Go 2.0.

Breaking changes: ADK Go 1.x to 2.0 incompatibilities

There are several known incompatibilities and breaking changes introduced with ADK Go v2.0.0. Before upgrading, review these changes and take mitigation steps, if necessary.

The ADK Go 2.0 release introduces the Workflow Runtime, transitioning ADK Go from a hierarchical agent executor to a graph-based execution engine. In this new architecture, your Agents, Tools, and Functions are evaluated as individual *nodes* within a workflow graph. If you are upgrading from ADK Go 1.x, review the following breaking changes and migration steps.

### Module import path

ADK Go 2.0 uses a new major version module path. You must update all import paths in your Go source files and your `go.mod` file.

- **1.x import path:** `google.golang.org/adk`
- **2.0 import path:** `google.golang.org/adk/v2`

**Migration action:** Run `go get google.golang.org/adk/v2` and update all import statements in your source files from `google.golang.org/adk/...` to `google.golang.org/adk/v2/...`.

### Agent Execution: Agent interface changes

In ADK Go 1.x, agents implemented the `agent.Agent` interface by providing a `Run` method. In ADK Go 2.0, agents are evaluated as individual *nodes* within the new Workflow Graph engine.

- **Execution driver custom overrides:** Custom agent types that override internal execution behavior may no longer work as expected. The Workflow Graph engine manages execution scheduling and event emission, and custom implementations that bypass these mechanisms are silently ignored.

**Migration action:** Move custom execution logic into standardized `BeforeAgentCallback` and `AfterAgentCallback` hooks to safely inject custom logic into the execution lifecycle.

### Event Construction: `session.NewEvent` signature change

`session.NewEvent` now requires a `context.Context` as its first argument:

```go
// Before (ADK Go 1.x)
ev := session.NewEvent(ctx.InvocationID())
// or
ev := session.NewEventWithContext(ctx, ctx.InvocationID())

// After (ADK Go 2.0)
ev := session.NewEvent(ctx, ctx.InvocationID())
```

The event ID and timestamp are now obtained through the `platform` package, so a time or UUID provider installed on `ctx` controls them. This lets workflow engines produce deterministic, replay-safe events. The previous parameterless-context form and the temporary `NewEventWithContext` helper are removed.

**Migration action:** Pass the context already in scope as the first argument to `session.NewEvent`. Any `context.Context` works — the `ctx` of an agent, tool, or callback (which embed `context.Context`), a request context, or in tests, `t.Context()`. If a helper that calls `NewEvent` does not yet receive a context, add a `ctx context.Context` parameter and thread it down from the caller. Avoid creating a new `context.Background()` mid-call-chain; reserve that for `main`, `init`, and top-level test setup.

### Event Schema & Custom Session Storage

ADK Go 2.0 adds five new fields to the core ***Event*** struct to support graph routing, workflow state, and human-in-the-loop pausing:

| Go field                       | Serialized name                                      | Purpose                                                              |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `IsolationScope string`        | `isolationScope` (`json:"isolationScope,omitempty"`) | Restricts which agent contexts see this event in LLM prompt history. |
| `Routes []string`              | `Routes` (no JSON tag)                               | Routing keys emitted by a node to drive conditional edge dispatch.   |
| `RequestedInput *RequestInput` | `RequestedInput` (no JSON tag)                       | Signals that a workflow node is pausing for human input.             |
| `Output any`                   | `Output` (no JSON tag)                               | Generic data output from a workflow node.                            |
| `NodeInfo *NodeInfo`           | `nodeInfo` (`json:"nodeInfo,omitempty"`)             | Workflow-node metadata identifying which node emitted the event.     |

- **Custom session storage:** If you have implemented a custom `session.Service`, such as storing sessions in your own SQL or NoSQL databases with rigid schemas, your underlying database schema must be updated to accommodate all five new fields. Inserting a 2.0 ***Event*** into a rigid 1.x database table causes insertion or deserialization failures. *However, if your custom session service stores events as serialized JSON blobs, you do not need to update your schema.*

**Migration action:** Update your database schemas and downstream client validators to expect and store the five new fields on all Event payloads. Pay particular attention to `Routes`, `RequestedInput`, and `Output`, which have no JSON struct tags and therefore serialize under their Go field names exactly as shown above.

If you encounter additional ADK Go 1.0 to ADK 2.0 incompatibilities, report them through the [issue tracker](https://github.com/google/adk-go/issues/new?template=bug_report.md&labels=v2).
