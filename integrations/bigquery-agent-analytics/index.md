# BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin for ADK

Supported in ADKPython v1.21.0Java v1.5.0Kotlin v0.8.0

The BigQuery Agent Analytics Plugin significantly enhances Agent Development Kit (ADK) by providing a robust solution for in-depth agent behavior analysis. Using the ADK Plugin architecture and the **BigQuery Storage Write API**, it captures and logs critical operational events directly into a Google BigQuery table, empowering you with advanced capabilities for debugging, real-time monitoring, and comprehensive offline performance evaluation.

The plugin also provides **Auto Schema Upgrade** (safely add new columns to existing tables), **Tool Provenance** tracking (LOCAL, MCP, SUB_AGENT, A2A, TRANSFER_AGENT, TRANSFER_A2A), **HITL Event Tracing** for human-in-the-loop interactions, and **Automatic View Creation** (generate flat, query-friendly event views).

Support for **ADK 2.0** multi-agent workflows extends tracing to agent transfers, state checkpoints, event compaction, and long-running tools. It adds four new event types — `AGENT_TRANSFER`, `AGENT_STATE_CHECKPOINT`, `EVENT_COMPACTION`, and `TOOL_PAUSED` — and stamps an `attributes.adk` envelope on every row so you can reconstruct the agent execution graph and join a paused tool to the row that resumes it. Java emits `TOOL_PAUSED` and its pause/resume keys only. See [Agent workflow and pause/resume events (ADK 2.0)](#adk-2-events) for details.

The plugin includes three reliability and observability fixes:

- **Cross-region Storage Write API routing.** Writes to BigQuery datasets outside the `US` multi-region (for example `EU` or `northamerica-northeast1`) now route to the region that owns the write stream. Previously they could fail with a "session not found" / stream-not-found error and silently drop every row.
- **Dropped-event observability.** Dropped rows are tracked per drop reason and exposed via `BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin.get_drop_stats()` (Python) or `getDropStats()` (Java) so a host can poll and export the counts to its own monitoring. The reason keys differ per language — see [Dropped-event observability](#dropped-event-observability).
- **No duplicate spans in Cloud Trace.** When Agent Engine telemetry (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_AGENT_ENGINE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true`) or any other Cloud Trace exporter is wired to the global tracer provider, the plugin no longer produces a duplicate span next to each framework span. The plugin still inherits `trace_id` from the ambient OTel span, so BigQuery rows continue to join cleanly to Cloud Trace traces.

BigQuery Storage Write API

This feature uses **BigQuery Storage Write API**, which is a paid service. For information on costs, see the [BigQuery documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/pricing?e=48754805&hl=en#data-ingestion-pricing).

Kotlin support

The **Kotlin** plugin logs invocation lifecycle events. It writes an `INVOCATION_STARTING` row when an invocation begins and an `INVOCATION_COMPLETED` row when it ends, and creates the partitioned, clustered events table on first use if it does not already exist.

Rows are inserted one at a time through `tabledata.insertAll`, synchronously on the invocation path, rather than through the Storage Write API used by Python and Java.

The following are not implemented in Kotlin: LLM, tool, agent, state, HITL and A2A events; the ADK 2.0 workflow events; automatic view creation; Auto Schema Upgrade; tool provenance; GCS offloading; and drop statistics.

## Use cases

- **Agent workflow debugging and analysis:** Capture a wide range of *plugin lifecycle events* (LLM calls, tool usage) and *agent-yielded events* (user input, model responses), into a well-defined schema.
- **High-volume analysis and debugging:** Logging operations are performed asynchronously using the Storage Write API to allow high throughput and low latency.
- **Multimodal Analysis**: Log and analyze text, images, and other modalities. Large files are offloaded to GCS, making them accessible to BigQuery ML via Object Tables.
- **Distributed Tracing**: Built-in support for OpenTelemetry-style tracing (`trace_id`, `span_id`) to visualize agent execution flows.
- **Tool Provenance**: Track the origin of each tool call (local function, MCP server, sub-agent, A2A remote agent, or transfer agent).
- **Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Tracing**: Dedicated event types for credential requests, confirmation prompts, and user input requests.
- **Agent Workflow Tracing** (ADK 2.0): Capture agent transfers, state checkpoints, event compaction, and long-running tool pause/resume, with an `attributes.adk` envelope for reconstructing the execution graph.
- **Queryable Event Views**: Automatically create flat, per-event-type BigQuery views (e.g., `v_llm_request`, `v_tool_completed`) to simplify downstream analytics by unnesting JSON payload data.

### Captured events summary

The following table lists all event types the plugin logs. For detailed payload examples, see [Event types and payloads](#event-types). The **View** column shows the BigQuery view optionally created when [`create_views`](#configuration-options) is enabled (the default).

In **Kotlin**, the plugin logs `INVOCATION_STARTING` and `INVOCATION_COMPLETED` only and creates no views, so the other rows and the entire **View** column apply to Python and Java.

## Quickstart

Add the plugin to your agent's `App` object. For prerequisites, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

agent.py

```python
import os
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.apps import App
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.plugins.bigquery_agent_analytics_plugin import BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin

os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT'] = 'your-gcp-project-id'
os.environ['GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION'] = 'us-central1'
os.environ['GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE'] = 'True'

plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id="your-gcp-project-id",
    dataset_id="your-big-query-dataset-id",
)

root_agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-flash-latest"),
    name='my_agent',
    instruction="You are a helpful assistant.",
)

app = App(
    name="my_agent",
    root_agent=root_agent,
    plugins=[plugin],
)
```

Add the plugin to your runner's plugins list. For prerequisites, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites).

Agent.java

```java
import com.google.adk.agents.LlmAgent;
import com.google.adk.agents.RunConfig;
import com.google.adk.models.Gemini;
import com.google.adk.plugins.Plugin;
import com.google.adk.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin;
import com.google.adk.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryLoggerConfig;
import com.google.adk.runner.InMemoryRunner;
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;

public final class Agent {
  public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
    Plugin bqLoggingPlugin = new BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
        BigQueryLoggerConfig.builder()
            .projectId("your-gcp-project-id")
            .datasetId("your-big-query-dataset-id")
            .tableName("agent_events") // Optional, defaults to "events" in Java
            .build());

    InMemoryRunner runner = new InMemoryRunner(
        LlmAgent.builder()
            .model(Gemini.builder().modelName("gemini-2.5-flash").build())
            .name("my_agent")
            .instruction("You are a helpful assistant.")
            .build(),
        "my_agent",
        ImmutableList.of(bqLoggingPlugin));

    // Use runner ...

    // Close runner to flush and close plugin
    runner.close().blockingAwait();
  }
}
```

Add the plugin to your agent's `App` object. For prerequisites, see [Prerequisites](#prerequisites). The plugin is JVM-only and ships outside core, so add the integrations artifact:

build.gradle.kts

```kotlin
implementation("com.google.adk:google-adk-kotlin-integrations:0.9.0")
```

BigQueryAnalyticsExample.kt

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.agents.Instruction
import com.google.adk.kt.agents.LlmAgent
import com.google.adk.kt.apps.App
import com.google.adk.kt.models.Gemini
import com.google.adk.kt.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin
import com.google.adk.kt.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryLoggerConfig

val analyticsAgent =
    LlmAgent(
        name = "my_agent",
        model = Gemini(name = "gemini-flash-latest"),
        instruction = Instruction("You are a helpful assistant."),
    )

/**
 * Wraps [analyticsAgent] in an [App] whose invocations are logged to BigQuery.
 *
 * The plugin creates the day-partitioned table on first use, so the credentials
 * in scope need permission to create a table in the dataset, not only to insert
 * rows. Without explicit `credentials`, application default credentials are used.
 *
 * Logging failures never fail the turn: a table that cannot be created, or a row
 * that cannot be inserted, is logged and the invocation carries on.
 */
fun analyticsApp(
    projectId: String,
    datasetId: String,
    datasetLocation: String,
): App {
    val plugin =
        BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
            config =
                BigQueryLoggerConfig(
                    projectId = projectId,
                    datasetId = datasetId,
                    // Defaults to "US"; pass your dataset's location instead.
                    location = datasetLocation,
                ),
        )

    return App(
        appName = "my_agent",
        rootAgent = analyticsAgent,
        plugins = listOf(plugin),
    )
}
```

The plugin creates the events table on first use, so the credentials in scope need permission to create a table in the dataset, not only to insert rows. Set `location` to your dataset's location; it defaults to `"US"`. For the full set of options, see [Configuration options](#configuration-options).

Logging never fails the turn: if the table cannot be created or a row cannot be inserted, the plugin logs the error and the invocation continues. When rows are missing, enable logging for `com.google.adk.kt.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin` — logs are emitted under that class name, not under the plugin's ADK name (`bigquery_agent_analytics`).

### Run and test agent

Test the plugin by running the agent and making a few requests through the chat interface, such as "tell me what you can do" or "List datasets in my cloud project ". These actions create events which are recorded in your Google Cloud project BigQuery instance. Once these events have been processed, you can view the data for them in the [BigQuery Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery), using this query:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, event_type, content
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-big-query-dataset-id.agent_events`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

# --- OpenTelemetry note (no setup required for BQAA) ---
# The BQAA plugin does NOT export OTel spans of its own. It tracks the
# parent-child hierarchy on an internal stack: the root invocation span
# reuses the ambient OTel span's id (as a 16-hex string) when one is
# active, and child BQAA spans are generated internally as 16-hex
# strings. The plugin's `trace_id`
# column inherits from whichever OpenTelemetry span is active in the
# surrounding runtime when the agent runs:
#   * Agent Engine wires its invocation span automatically, so
#     `trace_id` in BigQuery joins to Cloud Trace out of the box.
#   * Locally, framework-instrumented runners open an invocation span
#     for you.
#   * If neither is available, the plugin falls back to a per-invocation
#     trace_id and the parent-child hierarchy is still preserved in
#     BigQuery — no OTel setup needed.
# Setting a bare `TracerProvider` with no ambient span will NOT cause
# `trace_id` to be populated with a "real" OTel id; only an *active*
# span does. See the "Tracing and observability" section for details.

Deploying to Agent Runtime?

See [Deploy to Agent Runtime](#deploy-agent-runtime).

## Prerequisites

- **Google Cloud Project** with the **BigQuery API** enabled.
- **BigQuery Dataset:** Create a dataset to store logging tables before using the plugin. The plugin automatically creates the necessary events table within the dataset if the table does not exist.
- **Google Cloud Storage Bucket (Optional):** If you plan to log multimodal content (images, audio, etc.), creating a GCS bucket is recommended for offloading large files.
- **Authentication:**
  - **Local:** Run `gcloud auth application-default login`.
  - **Cloud:** Ensure your service account has the required permissions.

Note: Gemini model selector `gemini-flash-latest`

Most code examples in ADK documentation use `gemini-flash-latest` to select the [latest available](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models#latest) Gemini Flash version. However, if you access Gemini from a regional endpoint, such as `us-central1`, this selection string may not work. In that case, use a specific model version string from the [Gemini models](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/models) page or Google Cloud [Gemini models](https://docs.cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/models) list.

### IAM permissions

For the agent to work properly, the principal (e.g., service account, user account) under which the agent is running needs these Google Cloud roles:

- `roles/bigquery.jobUser` at Project Level to run BigQuery queries.
- `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` at Table Level to write log/event data.
- **If using GCS offloading:** `roles/storage.objectCreator` and `roles/storage.objectViewer` on the target bucket.

## Configuration options

### Constructor parameters

The `BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin` constructor accepts these parameters. It also accepts `**kwargs`, which are forwarded directly to `BigQueryLoggerConfig` (see below).

| Parameter     | Type                                            | Default      | Use when                                                                                                                                                                |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `project_id`  | `str`                                           | *(required)* | Select the Google Cloud project                                                                                                                                         |
| `dataset_id`  | `str`                                           | *(required)* | Select the BigQuery dataset                                                                                                                                             |
| `table_id`    | `Optional[str]`                                 | `None`       | Use a custom table name (overrides config `table_id`)                                                                                                                   |
| `config`      | `Optional[BigQueryLoggerConfig]`                | `None`       | Pass a config object for detailed tuning                                                                                                                                |
| `location`    | `str`                                           | `"US"`       | Match the BigQuery dataset location (e.g., `"US"`, `"EU"`, `"us-central1"`)                                                                                             |
| `credentials` | `Optional[google.auth.credentials.Credentials]` | `None`       | Use explicit service-account, impersonated, or cross-project credentials instead of [ADC](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/application-default-credentials) |

```python
plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id="my-project",
    dataset_id="my_dataset",
    batch_size=10,           # forwarded to BigQueryLoggerConfig
    shutdown_timeout=5.0,    # forwarded to BigQueryLoggerConfig
)
```

### Trace correlation, metadata capture, and column projection

Supported in ADKPython v2.4.0

Three options control what extra context lands in `attributes` — and whether payload columns are written at all. Each is listed in the `BigQueryLoggerConfig` options table above; the notes below add the cross-option rules the flat table can't express:

- **`enable_otel_correlation`** — the captured span context is a best-effort Cloud Trace correlation key, not a foreign key; when disabled (the default) no `attributes.otel` is written.
- **`custom_metadata_allowlist`** — leaving it unset preserves the previous behavior, where only the built-in `a2a:*` capture runs. Captured values pass the same safety pipeline as all other logged content (truncation, sensitive-key redaction, circular-reference handling).
- **`payload_column_denylist`** — only `content`, `content_parts`, `attributes`, and `latency_ms` may be listed; identity and correlation columns are protected and raise `ValueError`. The projection is applied schema-first, so the table schema, the written rows, and the auto-created views stay consistent (views drop derived columns that depend on a denied column). Denying `attributes` also disables `attributes.otel` and `attributes.custom_metadata`, and combining it with a non-empty `custom_metadata_allowlist` is rejected at construction.

```python
config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    enable_otel_correlation=True,                      # join key against Cloud Trace
    custom_metadata_allowlist=["ticket_id", "exp:*"],  # capture selected custom_metadata keys
    # payload_column_denylist=["content_parts"],       # don't persist multimodal payloads
)
```

In Java, all configuration is managed via the `BigQueryLoggerConfig` builder.

The following code sample shows how to define a configuration for the BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin in Java:

```java
import com.google.adk.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin;
import com.google.adk.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryLoggerConfig;
import java.time.Duration;
import java.util.function.BiFunction;

// Custom formatter to redact dollar amounts
BiFunction<Object, String, Object> redactDollarAmounts = (content, eventType) -> {
  String textContent = content.toString();
  return textContent.replaceAll("\\$\\d+(?:,\\d{3})*(?:\\.\\d+)?", "xxx");
};

BigQueryLoggerConfig config = BigQueryLoggerConfig.builder()
    .enabled(true)
    .projectId("my-project")
    .datasetId("my_dataset")
    .tableName("agent_events")
    .batchSize(1)
    .batchFlushInterval(Duration.ofMillis(500))
    .contentFormatter(redactDollarAmounts)
    .autoSchemaUpgrade(true)
    .createViews(true)
    .build();

BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin plugin = new BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(config);
```

In Kotlin, all configuration is managed via the `BigQueryLoggerConfig` data class, which the plugin takes as its only required argument.

The following code sample shows how to define a configuration for the BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin in Kotlin:

```kotlin
import com.google.adk.kt.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin
import com.google.adk.kt.plugins.agentanalytics.BigQueryLoggerConfig

val config =
    BigQueryLoggerConfig(
        projectId = "my-project",
        datasetId = "my_dataset",
        location = "EU",
        tableName = "agent_events",
    )

val plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(config = config)
```

The options listed under the **Python** and **Java** tabs, such as batching, content formatting, event allowlists, GCS offloading, and view creation, do not exist in Kotlin.

## Schema and production setup

### Schema Reference

The events table (`agent_events`) uses a flexible schema. The following table provides a comprehensive reference with example values.

| Field Name         | Type        | Mode       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Example Value                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Stays constant across multiple turns and sub-agent calls.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | `04275a01-1649-4a30-b6a7-5b443c69a7bc`                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **invocation_id**  | `STRING`    | `NULLABLE` | The unique identifier for a single execution turn or request cycle. Corresponds to `trace_id` in many contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | `e-b55b2000-68c6-4e8b-b3b3-ffb454a92e40`                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **user_id**        | `STRING`    | `NULLABLE` | The identifier of the user (human or system) initiating the session. Extracted from the `User` object or metadata.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | `test_user`                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **trace_id**       | `STRING`    | `NULLABLE` | Trace identifier. It is a 32-character hex OpenTelemetry trace ID when inherited from an ambient span (e.g. Agent Engine's invocation span or the ADK Runner span), so BigQuery rows join cleanly to your existing Cloud Trace traces. Without an ambient span, Python also generates that format as its per-invocation fallback, while Java falls back to the ADK invocation ID. Links all operations within a single distributed request lifecycle.                                                                                         | `a2c7f13d3a3f0bbb8793692f76a6012a`                                                                                                                                                                           |
| **span_id**        | `STRING`    | `NULLABLE` | 16-character hex Span ID identifying this specific atomic operation. **Tracked on the plugin's internal stack, not exported as an OTel span** — the plugin does not call `tracer.start_span` against your configured OpenTelemetry provider. The root invocation span reuses the ambient OTel span's id when one is active; child spans are generated internally (see [Tracing and observability](#tracing-and-observability)).                                                                                                               | `3916f5762bcd4d42`                                                                                                                                                                                           |

In **Kotlin**, the plugin creates the table with these same columns but populates only `timestamp`, `event_type`, `agent`, `session_id`, `invocation_id`, `user_id`, and `content`. The remaining columns are always null.

The plugin automatically creates the table if it does not exist. For production, you can optionally create the table manually using the DDL below.

Manual DDL for production setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE `your-gcp-project-id.adk_agent_logs.agent_events`
(
  timestamp TIMESTAMP NOT NULL OPTIONS(description="The UTC time at which the event was logged."),
  event_type STRING OPTIONS(description="Indicates the type of event being logged (e.g., 'LLM_REQUEST', 'TOOL_COMPLETED')."),
  agent STRING OPTIONS(description="The name of the ADK agent or author associated with the event."),
  session_id STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier to group events within a single conversation or user session."),
  invocation_id STRING OPTIONS(description="A unique identifier for each individual agent execution or turn within a session."),
  user_id STRING OPTIONS(description="The identifier of the user associated with the current session."),
  trace_id STRING OPTIONS(description="32-char hex trace ID. Inherited from the ambient OpenTelemetry span when one is active; otherwise generated per invocation by the plugin."),
  span_id STRING OPTIONS(description="16-char hex span ID for this specific operation. Tracked on the plugin's internal stack; the root invocation span may reuse the ambient OTel span id, while child BQAA spans are generated internally. No OpenTelemetry span is created or exported."),
  parent_span_id STRING OPTIONS(description="16-char hex span ID of the immediate caller, used to reconstruct the parent-child execution tree."),
  content JSON OPTIONS(description="The event-specific data (payload) stored as JSON."),
  content_parts ARRAY<STRUCT<
    mime_type STRING,
    uri STRING,
    object_ref STRUCT<
      uri STRING,
      version STRING,
      authorizer STRING,
      details JSON
    >,
    text STRING,
    part_index INT64,
    part_attributes STRING,
    storage_mode STRING
  >> OPTIONS(description="Detailed content parts for multi-modal data."),
  attributes JSON OPTIONS(description="Arbitrary key-value pairs for additional metadata (e.g., 'root_agent_name', 'model_version', 'usage_metadata', 'session_metadata', 'custom_tags')."),
  latency_ms JSON OPTIONS(description="Latency measurements (e.g., total_ms)."),
  status STRING OPTIONS(description="The outcome of the event, typically 'OK' or 'ERROR'."),
  error_message STRING OPTIONS(description="Populated if an error occurs."),
  is_truncated BOOLEAN OPTIONS(description="Flag indicates if content was truncated.")
)
PARTITION BY DATE(timestamp)
CLUSTER BY event_type, agent, user_id;
```

### Automatically Created Views

Supported in ADKPython v1.27.0

When `create_views=True` (the default), the plugin automatically generates views for each event type that unnest common JSON structures into flat, typed columns. This significantly simplifies SQL, eliminating the need to write complex `JSON_VALUE` or `JSON_QUERY` functions explicitly.

View names follow the convention `{view_prefix}_{event_type_lowercase}` (for example, with the default prefix `"v"`, `LLM_REQUEST` becomes `v_llm_request`). Set `view_prefix` in `BigQueryLoggerConfig` to a distinct value when multiple plugin instances write to different tables in the same dataset, preventing view-name collisions:

```python
# Two plugins in the same dataset with distinct view prefixes
plugin_prod = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID, dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    table_id="agent_events_prod",
    config=BigQueryLoggerConfig(view_prefix="v_prod"),
)
# Creates views: v_prod_llm_request, v_prod_tool_completed, ...

plugin_staging = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID, dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    table_id="agent_events_staging",
    config=BigQueryLoggerConfig(view_prefix="v_staging"),
)
# Creates views: v_staging_llm_request, v_staging_tool_completed, ...
```

You can also call the public async method `await plugin.create_analytics_views()` to manually refresh views, for example after a schema upgrade.

Every view includes these **common columns**: `timestamp`, `event_type`, `agent`, `session_id`, `invocation_id`, `user_id`, `trace_id`, `span_id`, `parent_span_id`, `status`, `error_message`, `is_truncated`.

The following table lists all auto-created views and their event-specific columns:

| View Name                         | Event-Specific Columns                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

The four workflow views (`v_agent_transfer`, `v_agent_state_checkpoint`, `v_event_compaction`, `v_tool_paused`) and the `pause_kind` / `function_call_id` columns on `v_tool_completed` come with the [ADK 2.0 workflow event support](#adk-2-events). In **Java**, only `v_tool_paused` and the `pause_kind` / `function_call_id` columns on `v_tool_completed` are created; `v_agent_transfer`, `v_agent_state_checkpoint`, and `v_event_compaction` are Python-only (the Java plugin does not emit those events).

## Event types and payloads

The `content` column now contains a **JSON** object specific to the `event_type`. The `content_parts` column provides a structured view of the content, especially useful for images or offloaded data.

Content Truncation

- Variable content fields are truncated to `max_content_length` (configured in `BigQueryLoggerConfig`, default 500KB).
- If `gcs_bucket_name` is configured, large content is offloaded to GCS instead of being truncated, and a reference is stored in `content_parts.object_ref`.

### LLM interactions (plugin lifecycle)

These events track the raw requests sent to and responses received from the LLM.

**1. LLM_REQUEST**

Captures the prompt sent to the model, including conversation history and system instructions.

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_REQUEST",
  "content": {
    "system_prompt": "You are a helpful assistant...",
    "prompt": [
      {
        "role": "user",
        "content": "hello how are you today"
      }
    ]
  },
  "attributes": {
    "root_agent_name": "my_bq_agent",
    "model": "gemini-flash-latest",
    "tools": ["list_dataset_ids", "execute_sql"],
    "llm_config": {
      "temperature": 0.5,
      "top_p": 0.9
    }
  }
}
```

The automatically created `v_llm_request` view exposes the `tools` attribute as its `tools` (JSON) column.

**2. LLM_RESPONSE**

Captures the model's output and token usage statistics.

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_RESPONSE",
  "content": {
    "response": "text: 'Hello! I'm doing well...'",
    "usage": {
      "completion": 19,
      "prompt": 10129,
      "total": 10148
    }
  },
  "attributes": {
    "root_agent_name": "my_bq_agent",
    "model_version": "gemini-flash-latest",
    "usage_metadata": {
      "prompt_token_count": 10129,
      "candidates_token_count": 19,
      "total_token_count": 10148
    }
  },
  "latency_ms": {
    "time_to_first_token_ms": 2579,
    "total_ms": 2579
  }
}
```

**3. LLM_ERROR**

Logged when an LLM call fails with an exception. The error message is captured and the span is closed.

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_ERROR",
  "content": null,
  "attributes": {
    "root_agent_name": "my_bq_agent"
  },
  "error_message": "Error 429: Resource exhausted",
  "latency_ms": {
    "total_ms": 350
  }
}
```

### Tool usage (plugin lifecycle)

These events track the execution of tools by the agent. Each tool event includes a `tool_origin` field that classifies the tool's provenance:

| Tool Origin      | Description                                                                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `LOCAL`          | `FunctionTool` instances (local Python functions)                                              |
| `MCP`            | Model Context Protocol tools (`McpTool` instances)                                             |
| `SUB_AGENT`      | `AgentTool` instances (sub-agents)                                                             |
| `A2A`            | Remote Agent2Agent instances (`RemoteA2aAgent`)                                                |
| `TRANSFER_AGENT` | `TransferToAgentTool` instances (generic agent transfer)                                       |
| `TRANSFER_A2A`   | `TransferToAgentTool` instances that transfer to a `RemoteA2aAgent` (classified at call-level) |
| `UNKNOWN`        | Unclassified tools                                                                             |

**4. TOOL_STARTING**

Logged when an agent begins executing a tool.

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_STARTING",
  "content": {
    "tool": "list_dataset_ids",
    "args": {
      "project_id": "bigquery-public-data"
    },
    "tool_origin": "LOCAL"
  }
}
```

**5. TOOL_COMPLETED**

Logged when a tool execution finishes.

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_COMPLETED",
  "content": {
    "tool": "list_dataset_ids",
    "result": [
      "austin_311",
      "austin_bikeshare"
    ],
    "tool_origin": "LOCAL"
  },
  "latency_ms": {
    "total_ms": 467
  }
}
```

**6. TOOL_ERROR**

Logged when a tool execution fails with an exception. Captures the tool name, arguments, tool origin, and error message.

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_ERROR",
  "content": {
    "tool": "list_dataset_ids",
    "args": {
      "project_id": "nonexistent-project"
    },
    "tool_origin": "LOCAL"
  },
  "error_message": "Error 404: Dataset not found",
  "latency_ms": {
    "total_ms": 150
  }
}
```

### State Management

These events track changes to the agent's state, typically triggered by tools.

**7. STATE_DELTA**

Tracks changes to the agent's internal state (e.g., custom application state updated by tools).

Built-in redaction

State keys prefixed with `temp:` or `secret:` are automatically redacted to `[REDACTED]` in the logged `state_delta` (Java: `temp:` only). See [Built-in redaction](#built-in-redaction) for details.

```json
{
  "event_type": "STATE_DELTA",
  "attributes": {
    "state_delta": {
      "customer_tier": "enterprise",
      "last_query_dataset": "bigquery-public-data.samples"
    }
  }
}
```

### Agent lifecycle & Generic Events

| Event Type              | Content (JSON) Structure                     |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `INVOCATION_STARTING`   | `{}`                                         |
| `INVOCATION_COMPLETED`  | `{}`                                         |
| `AGENT_STARTING`        | `"You are a helpful agent..."`               |
| `AGENT_COMPLETED`       | `{}`                                         |
| `USER_MESSAGE_RECEIVED` | `{"text_summary": "Help me book a flight."}` |
| `AGENT_RESPONSE`        | `{"response": "Here are the flights..."}`    |

In **Kotlin**, the two invocation events carry a summary message instead of an empty object: `{"message": "Invocation started"}` and `{"message": "Invocation completed"}`.

**AGENT_RESPONSE**

Logged when the agent yields a final response to the user. The response text is stored in `content`, while the source event metadata is stored in `attributes`.

```json
{
  "event_type": "AGENT_RESPONSE",
  "content": {
    "response": "Here are the available flights..."
  },
  "attributes": {
    "source_event_id": "evt-abc123",
    "source_event_author": "flight_agent",
    "source_event_branch": "main"
  }
}
```

### Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) Events

The plugin automatically detects calls to ADK's synthetic HITL tools and emits dedicated event types for them. These events are logged **in addition to** the normal `TOOL_STARTING` / `TOOL_COMPLETED` events.

The following HITL tool names are recognized:

- `adk_request_credential`: Request for user credentials (e.g., OAuth tokens)
- `adk_request_confirmation`: Request for user confirmation before proceeding
- `adk_request_input`: Request for free-form user input

| Event Type                            | Trigger                                | Content (JSON) Structure                                |
| ------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| `HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST`             | Agent calls `adk_request_credential`   | `{"tool": "adk_request_credential", "args": {...}}`     |
| `HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_COMPLETED`   | User provides credential response      | `{"tool": "adk_request_credential", "result": {...}}`   |
| `HITL_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST`           | Agent calls `adk_request_confirmation` | `{"tool": "adk_request_confirmation", "args": {...}}`   |
| `HITL_CONFIRMATION_REQUEST_COMPLETED` | User provides confirmation response    | `{"tool": "adk_request_confirmation", "result": {...}}` |
| `HITL_INPUT_REQUEST`                  | Agent calls `adk_request_input`        | `{"tool": "adk_request_input", "args": {...}}`          |
| `HITL_INPUT_REQUEST_COMPLETED`        | User provides input response           | `{"tool": "adk_request_input", "result": {...}}`        |

HITL request events are detected from `function_call` parts in `on_event_callback`. HITL completion events are detected from `function_response` parts in both `on_event_callback` and `on_user_message_callback`.

Views for HITL events

Auto-created views exist only for the three **request** event types (`v_hitl_credential_request`, `v_hitl_confirmation_request`, `v_hitl_input_request`). The three `*_COMPLETED` event types are logged to the base table but do not have dedicated views. Query them directly from the `agent_events` table using `WHERE event_type LIKE 'HITL_%_COMPLETED'`.

### A2A Interaction Events

When your agent communicates with a remote agent via the Agent2Agent (A2A) protocol, the plugin logs an `A2A_INTERACTION` event capturing the request and response details.

**A2A_INTERACTION**

Logged when an A2A remote agent call completes.

```json
{
  "event_type": "A2A_INTERACTION",
  "content": {
    "response_content": "The remote agent's response...",
    "a2a_task_id": "task-abc123",
    "a2a_context_id": "ctx-def456",
    "a2a_request": { ... },
    "a2a_response": { ... }
  }
}
```

### Agent workflow and pause/resume events (ADK 2.0)

Supported in ADKPython v2.3.0Java v1.7.0

Java support

The **Java** plugin supports a subset of this section: it emits `TOOL_PAUSED` and the pause/resume pairing described below, but does **not** emit `AGENT_TRANSFER`, `AGENT_STATE_CHECKPOINT`, or `EVENT_COMPACTION`, and does not write the `attributes.adk` envelope.

ADK 2.0 introduced multi-agent workflows (agents that transfer control, checkpoint their state, and compact long histories) and long-running tools that pause and resume across turns. The plugin makes these flows observable with four new event types and a small metadata envelope, `attributes.adk`, that ties the rows back to the ADK event that produced them.

#### The `attributes.adk` envelope

The envelope is written by the **Python** plugin only. Every row now carries an `attributes.adk` object. `schema_version` and `app_name` are always present; the remaining fields are added only for rows that originate from an ADK event (lifecycle and workflow events), so on a callback-only row they are simply absent (and resolve to SQL `NULL` when queried).

| Field              | Type   | Meaning                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| ------------------ | ------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `schema_version`   | string | Envelope version (currently `"1"`). Gate downstream queries on this when the envelope evolves.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `app_name`         | string | The ADK app that produced the row.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `source_event_id`  | string | ID of the originating ADK `Event`. The reliable key for joining the multiple rows a single event can produce.                                                                                                                                                                      |
| `node`             | object | Workflow node identity: `{ "path", "run_id", "parent_run_id" }`. `parent_run_id` is the run ID of the parent node (`null` at the root).                                                                                                                                            |
| `branch`           | string | The event's branch, when the workflow runs branched paths.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `scope`            | object | Isolation scope `{ "id", "kind" }`, where `kind` is `node_run` (a workflow node run, e.g. `loopA@42`), `function_call` (a model-generated call ID), or `unknown`.                                                                                                                  |
| `pause_kind`       | string | On `TOOL_PAUSED`: `tool` for a regular long-running tool, or `hitl_credential` / `hitl_confirmation` / `hitl_input` for a HITL request. On a resumed `TOOL_COMPLETED` row it is always `tool` — HITL completions are logged as `HITL_*_REQUEST_COMPLETED`, never `TOOL_COMPLETED`. |
| `function_call_id` | string | The function call ID. Set on `TOOL_PAUSED` and on the matching resumed `TOOL_COMPLETED` row so the two can be paired (ordinary tools only).                                                                                                                                        |

Querying the envelope

Read envelope fields with `JSON_VALUE(attributes, '$.adk.<field>')` (or `JSON_QUERY` for the `node` / `scope` objects). The auto-created views already expose the commonly used fields (`source_event_id`, `pause_kind`, `function_call_id`) as flat columns, so most queries can use the view instead.

#### AGENT_TRANSFER

Logged when one agent hands off control to another (for example, a coordinator routing to a specialist sub-agent).

```json
{
  "event_type": "AGENT_TRANSFER",
  "content": {
    "from_agent": "coordinator",
    "to_agent": "flight_agent"
  },
  "attributes": {
    "adk": { "source_event_id": "evt-abc123" }
  }
}
```

#### AGENT_STATE_CHECKPOINT

Logged when an agent snapshots its state. The plugin also emits a checkpoint with `end_of_agent: true` to mark the end of an agent's run. The `v_agent_state_checkpoint` view exposes `agent_state_type` so you can distinguish a real state object from an explicit `null` checkpoint (the end-of-run marker) versus an absent value.

```json
{
  "event_type": "AGENT_STATE_CHECKPOINT",
  "content": {
    "agent_state": { "step": 3, "retries": 0 },
    "end_of_agent": false
  },
  "attributes": {
    "adk": { "source_event_id": "evt-def456" }
  }
}
```

#### EVENT_COMPACTION

Logged when ADK compacts a window of earlier events into a summary (used to keep long conversations within the context window). The timestamps are fractional epoch seconds; the view also exposes them as BigQuery `TIMESTAMP` columns (`window_start`, `window_end`). `compacted_content` holds the plugin-formatted text of the compacted window (a string), not a structured object.

```json
{
  "event_type": "EVENT_COMPACTION",
  "content": {
    "start_timestamp": 1733856000.123,
    "end_timestamp": 1733856120.456,
    "compacted_content": "User booked a flight to SFO, then asked about baggage..."
  }
}
```

#### TOOL_PAUSED and pause/resume pairing

An ordinary long-running tool emits a `TOOL_PAUSED` row when it yields, and a `TOOL_COMPLETED` row when its result arrives — often on a later turn. Both rows carry the same `function_call_id` and a `pause_kind` of `tool`, so you can pair a pause with its completion and measure how long the tool was suspended. (HITL requests also emit `TOOL_PAUSED`, but their completions are logged differently — see the note below.)

```json
{
  "event_type": "TOOL_PAUSED",
  "content": {
    "tool": "request_manager_approval",
    "args": { "amount": 5000 }
  },
  "attributes": {
    "adk": { "pause_kind": "tool", "function_call_id": "call-789" }
  }
}
```

Java attribute location

The Java plugin writes the pair keys at the top level of `attributes` — `"attributes": {"pause_kind": "tool", "function_call_id": "call-789"}` — with no `adk` wrapper. In the base-table query below, replace `'$.adk.pause_kind'` / `'$.adk.function_call_id'` with `'$.pause_kind'` / `'$.function_call_id'`. The view-based query works unchanged for both languages, because the views expose the keys as flat columns.

Java also stamps the same top-level pair keys on `HITL_*_REQUEST_COMPLETED` rows, so a HITL `TOOL_PAUSED` row can be joined directly to its completion on `function_call_id` in the base table (there is no dedicated view for HITL completions).

Relationship to HITL events

A HITL request (`adk_request_confirmation`, etc.) still emits its dedicated `HITL_*_REQUEST` event as described in [HITL events](#hitl-events). When that request is also long-running, the plugin additionally emits a `TOOL_PAUSED` row whose `pause_kind` identifies the HITL kind (for example `hitl_confirmation`) — giving HITL pauses the same visibility as tool pauses.

**A HITL completion does not arrive as `TOOL_COMPLETED`, though.** The user's response is logged as the corresponding `HITL_*_REQUEST_COMPLETED` event, not `TOOL_COMPLETED`, so a `hitl_*` pause will not pair through the tool join below. To see a HITL pause resolve, look to its `HITL_*_REQUEST_COMPLETED` event (see [HITL events](#hitl-events)). The pause/resume queries below are therefore scoped to ordinary tools (`pause_kind = 'tool'`).

Pair paused tools with their completions using the shared keys. On the base table:

```sql
SELECT
  p.timestamp AS paused_at,
  c.timestamp AS resumed_at,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(c.timestamp, p.timestamp, SECOND) AS paused_seconds,
  JSON_VALUE(p.content, '$.tool') AS tool_name,
  JSON_VALUE(p.attributes, '$.adk.pause_kind') AS pause_kind
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.adk_agent_logs.agent_events` AS p
JOIN `your-gcp-project-id.adk_agent_logs.agent_events` AS c
  ON  c.event_type = 'TOOL_COMPLETED'
  AND c.session_id = p.session_id
  AND c.user_id = p.user_id
  AND JSON_VALUE(c.attributes, '$.adk.function_call_id')
      = JSON_VALUE(p.attributes, '$.adk.function_call_id')
WHERE p.event_type = 'TOOL_PAUSED'
  AND JSON_VALUE(p.attributes, '$.adk.pause_kind') = 'tool'
ORDER BY paused_at;
```

Or, more simply, against the auto-created views, which expose `pause_kind` and `function_call_id` as flat columns:

```sql
SELECT
  p.timestamp AS paused_at,
  c.timestamp AS resumed_at,
  TIMESTAMP_DIFF(c.timestamp, p.timestamp, SECOND) AS paused_seconds,
  p.tool_name,
  p.pause_kind
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.adk_agent_logs.v_tool_paused` AS p
JOIN `your-gcp-project-id.adk_agent_logs.v_tool_completed` AS c
  USING (session_id, user_id, function_call_id)
WHERE p.pause_kind = 'tool'
ORDER BY paused_at;
```

## Storage behavior: GCS offloading

When `gcs_bucket_name` is configured in `BigQueryLoggerConfig`, the plugin automatically offloads large text and multimodal content (images, audio, etc.) to Google Cloud Storage. The `content` column will contain a summary or placeholder, while `content_parts` stores the `object_ref` pointing to the GCS URI. See also `connection_id` and `max_content_length` in [Configuration options](#configuration-options).

### Offloaded Text Example

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_REQUEST",
  "content_parts": [
    {
      "part_index": 1,
      "mime_type": "text/plain",
      "storage_mode": "GCS_REFERENCE",
      "text": "AAAA... [OFFLOADED]",
      "object_ref": {
        "uri": "gs://sample-bucket-name/2025-12-10/e-f9545d6d/ae5235e6_p1.txt",
        "authorizer": "us.bqml_connection",
        "details": {"gcs_metadata": {"content_type": "text/plain"}}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Offloaded Image Example

```json
{
  "event_type": "LLM_REQUEST",
  "content_parts": [
    {
      "part_index": 2,
      "mime_type": "image/png",
      "storage_mode": "GCS_REFERENCE",
      "text": "[MEDIA OFFLOADED]",
      "object_ref": {
        "uri": "gs://sample-bucket-name/2025-12-10/e-f9545d6d/ae5235e6_p2.png",
        "authorizer": "us.bqml_connection",
        "details": {"gcs_metadata": {"content_type": "image/png"}}
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Querying Offloaded Content (Get Signed URLs)

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  event_type,
  part.mime_type,
  part.storage_mode,
  part.object_ref.uri AS gcs_uri,
  -- Generate a signed URL to read the content directly (requires connection_id configuration)
  STRING(OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL(part.object_ref, 'r').access_urls.read_url) AS signed_url
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`,
UNNEST(content_parts) AS part
WHERE part.storage_mode = 'GCS_REFERENCE'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Query recipes

### Debug a run

#### Trace a specific conversation turn using trace_id

```sql
SELECT timestamp, event_type, agent, JSON_VALUE(content, '$.response') as summary
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
WHERE trace_id = 'your-trace-id'
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
```

#### Span Hierarchy & Duration Analysis

```sql
SELECT
  span_id,
  parent_span_id,
  event_type,
  timestamp,
  -- Extract duration from latency_ms for completed operations
  CAST(JSON_VALUE(latency_ms, '$.total_ms') AS INT64) as duration_ms,
  -- Identify the specific tool or operation
  COALESCE(
    JSON_VALUE(content, '$.tool'),
    'LLM_CALL'
  ) as operation
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
WHERE trace_id = 'your-trace-id'
  AND event_type IN ('LLM_RESPONSE', 'TOOL_COMPLETED')
ORDER BY timestamp ASC;
```

#### Error Analysis (LLM & Tool Errors)

Using views (recommended):

```sql
-- Tool errors with provenance
SELECT timestamp, agent, tool_name, tool_origin, error_message, total_ms
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.v_tool_error`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- LLM errors
SELECT timestamp, agent, error_message, total_ms
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.v_llm_error`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Monitor cost and performance

#### Token usage analysis

Using the `v_llm_response` view (recommended):

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(usage_total_tokens) as avg_tokens,
  AVG(usage_prompt_tokens) as avg_prompt_tokens,
  AVG(usage_completion_tokens) as avg_completion_tokens
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.v_llm_response`;
```

Or using the base table with JSON extraction:

```sql
SELECT
  AVG(CAST(JSON_VALUE(content, '$.usage.total') AS INT64)) as avg_tokens
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
WHERE event_type = 'LLM_RESPONSE';
```

#### Latency Analysis (LLM & Tools)

Using views (recommended):

```sql
-- LLM latency
SELECT AVG(total_ms) as avg_llm_ms, AVG(ttft_ms) as avg_ttft_ms
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.v_llm_response`;

-- Tool latency by tool name
SELECT tool_name, tool_origin, AVG(total_ms) as avg_tool_ms
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.v_tool_completed`
GROUP BY tool_name, tool_origin
ORDER BY avg_tool_ms DESC;
```

Or using the base table:

```sql
SELECT
  event_type,
  AVG(CAST(JSON_VALUE(latency_ms, '$.total_ms') AS INT64)) as avg_latency_ms
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
WHERE event_type IN ('LLM_RESPONSE', 'TOOL_COMPLETED')
GROUP BY event_type;
```

### Inspect tools and interactions

#### Tool Provenance Analysis

Using the `v_tool_completed` view (recommended):

```sql
SELECT
  tool_origin,
  tool_name,
  COUNT(*) as call_count,
  AVG(total_ms) as avg_latency_ms
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.v_tool_completed`
GROUP BY tool_origin, tool_name
ORDER BY call_count DESC;
```

#### HITL Interaction Analysis

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  event_type,
  session_id,
  JSON_VALUE(content, '$.tool') as hitl_tool,
  content
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
WHERE event_type LIKE 'HITL_%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

### Analyze multimodal content

#### Querying Multimodal Content (using content_parts and ObjectRef)

```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  part.mime_type,
  part.object_ref.uri as gcs_uri
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`,
UNNEST(content_parts) as part
WHERE part.mime_type LIKE 'image/%'
ORDER BY timestamp DESC;
```

#### Analyze Multimodal Content with BigQuery Remote Model (Gemini)

```sql
SELECT
  logs.session_id,
  -- Get a signed URL for the image
  STRING(OBJ.GET_ACCESS_URL(parts.object_ref, "r").access_urls.read_url) as signed_url,
  -- Analyze the image using a remote model (e.g., gemini-pro-vision)
  AI.GENERATE(
    ('Describe this image briefly. What company logo?', parts.object_ref)
  ) AS generated_result
FROM
  `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events` logs,
  UNNEST(logs.content_parts) AS parts
WHERE
  parts.mime_type LIKE 'image/%'
ORDER BY logs.timestamp DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### AI-powered root cause analysis

Automatically analyze failed sessions to determine the root cause of errors using BigQuery ML and Gemini.

```sql
DECLARE failed_session_id STRING;
-- Find a recent failed session
SET failed_session_id = (
    SELECT session_id
    FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
    WHERE error_message IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY timestamp DESC
    LIMIT 1
);

-- Reconstruct the full conversation context
WITH SessionContext AS (
    SELECT
        session_id,
        STRING_AGG(CONCAT(event_type, ': ', COALESCE(TO_JSON_STRING(content), '')), '\n' ORDER BY timestamp) as full_history
    FROM `your-gcp-project-id.your-dataset-id.agent_events`
    WHERE session_id = failed_session_id
    GROUP BY session_id
)
-- Ask Gemini to diagnose the issue
SELECT
    session_id,
    AI.GENERATE(
        ('Analyze this conversation log and explain the root cause of the failure. Log: ', full_history),
        endpoint => 'gemini-flash-latest'
    ).result AS root_cause_explanation
FROM SessionContext;
```

### Conversational Analytics

You can also use [BigQuery Conversational Analytics](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/conversational-analytics) to analyze your agent logs using natural language. Create a conversational analytics agent in the [BigQuery Agents Hub](https://console.cloud.google.com/bigquery/agents_hub) connected to your `agent_events` table, then ask questions like:

- "Show me the error rate over time"
- "What are the most common tool calls?"
- "Identify sessions with high token usage"

## The context graph

Beyond row-level `agent_events`, the [BigQuery Agent Analytics SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK) can materialize a **context graph**: a queryable BigQuery [property graph](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/graph-overview) of your agent's decisions — the requests it handled, the options it weighed, and the outcomes it chose. It lets you trace *why* a decision happened with Graph Query Language (GQL), not just *that* an event was logged.

The graph is defined by two declarative artifacts — your table DDL and a `CREATE PROPERTY GRAPH` schema — and the SDK's `bqaa context-graph --property-graph` command derives the extraction (which entities and relationships to pull, and their column types) from them plus your live table schemas. No separate ontology or binding file is required for the common case; reach for an explicit `ontology.yaml` / `binding.yaml` only when you need descriptions to steer the AI prompt, entity inheritance, derived properties, or column renames.

Run it once locally, or on a schedule as a Cloud Run Job triggered by Cloud Scheduler — with split read-only-events / writable-graph datasets, least-privilege service accounts, structured JSON logs, and Cloud Monitoring alerts. The operational reference (prerequisites, the IAM matrix, recommended schedules, the JSON log shape, monitoring, and teardown) lives in the SDK repo:

- [Periodic materialization codelab](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/blob/main/docs/codelabs/periodic_materialization.md) — build and query a decision graph end to end.
- [Scheduled deploy runbook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/blob/main/docs/guides/scheduled-context-graph-deploy.md) — take that graph to a hands-off scheduled deploy.
- [Deploy reference (Cloud Run + Cloud Scheduler)](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/blob/main/examples/context_graph/periodic_materialization/README.md) — the full IAM matrix, schedules, monitoring, and the Terraform module.

## Deploy to Agent Runtime with the plugin

You can deploy an agent with the BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin to [Agent Runtime](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview). This section walks through the steps to deploy using the ADK CLI, and alternatively using the Agent Platform SDK programmatically.

Version Requirement

Use ADK Python version **1.24.0 or higher** to deploy with this plugin to Agent Runtime. Earlier versions had an issue where the plugin's asynchronous log writer could be terminated by the serverless runtime before flushing pending events. Starting from 1.24.0, the plugin performs a synchronous flush at the end of each invocation to ensure all events are written.

### Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have completed the general [Agent Runtime setup](/deploy/agent-runtime/deploy/#setup-cloud-project), including:

1. A Google Cloud project with the **Agent Platform API** and **Cloud Resource Manager API** enabled.
1. A **BigQuery dataset** in the target project (or a cross-project dataset with the correct permissions).
1. A **Cloud Storage staging bucket** for deployment artifacts.
1. The deploying service account has the IAM roles listed in [IAM permissions](#iam-permissions).
1. Your coding environment is [authenticated](/deploy/agent-runtime/deploy/#prerequisites-coding-env) with `gcloud auth login` and `gcloud auth application-default login`.

### Step 1: Define the agent and plugin

Create your agent project folder with an `App` object that includes the plugin. The `App` object is required for Agent Runtime deployments with plugins.

my_bq_agent/__init__.py

```python
from . import agent
```

my_bq_agent/agent.py

```python
import os
import google.auth
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.apps import App
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.plugins.bigquery_agent_analytics_plugin import (
    BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin,
    BigQueryLoggerConfig,
)
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# --- Configuration ---
PROJECT_ID = os.environ.get("GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT", "your-gcp-project-id")
DATASET_ID = os.environ.get("BQ_DATASET", "agent_analytics")
# BQ_LOCATION is the BigQuery dataset location (multi-region "US"/"EU" or
# a single region like "us-central1"). This is separate from the Agent Platform
# region used by GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION.
BQ_LOCATION = os.environ.get("BQ_LOCATION", "US")

os.environ["GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_ENTERPRISE"] = "True"

# --- Plugin ---
bq_analytics_plugin = BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
    project_id=PROJECT_ID,
    dataset_id=DATASET_ID,
    location=BQ_LOCATION,
    config=BigQueryLoggerConfig(
        batch_size=1,

```

### Step 2: Deploy using ADK CLI

Use the `adk deploy agent_engine` command to deploy the agent. The `--adk_app` flag tells the CLI which `App` object to use:

```shell
PROJECT_ID=your-gcp-project-id
LOCATION=us-central1

adk deploy agent_engine \
    --project=$PROJECT_ID \
    --region=$LOCATION \
    --staging_bucket=gs://your-staging-bucket \
    --display_name="My BQ Analytics Agent" \
    --adk_app=agent.app \
    my_bq_agent
```

`--adk_app` flag

The `--adk_app` flag specifies the module path and variable name of the `App` object (in the format `module.variable`). In this example, `agent.app` refers to the `app` variable in `agent.py`. This ensures the deployment correctly picks up the plugin configuration.

Once successfully deployed, you should see output like:

```shell
AgentEngine created. Resource name: projects/123456789/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/751619551677906944
```

Note the **Resource name** for the next step.

### Step 3: Test the deployed agent

After deployment, you can query the agent using the Agent Platform SDK:

test_deployed_agent.py

```python
import uuid
import vertexai

PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
AGENT_ID = "751619551677906944"  # from deployment output

vertexai.init(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)
client = vertexai.Client(project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION)

agent = client.agent_engines.get(
    name=f"projects/{PROJECT_ID}/locations/{LOCATION}/reasoningEngines/{AGENT_ID}"
)

user_id = f"test_user_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}"
for chunk in agent.stream_query(
    message="List datasets in my project", user_id=user_id
):
    print(chunk, end="", flush=True)
```

### Step 4: Verify events in BigQuery

After sending a few queries to the deployed agent, verify that events are being logged by querying your BigQuery table:

```sql
SELECT timestamp, event_type, agent, content
FROM `your-gcp-project-id.agent_analytics.agent_events`
ORDER BY timestamp DESC
LIMIT 20;
```

You should see events such as `INVOCATION_STARTING`, `LLM_REQUEST`, `LLM_RESPONSE`, `TOOL_STARTING`, `TOOL_COMPLETED`, and `INVOCATION_COMPLETED`.

### Alternative: Deploy using the Agent Platform SDK

You can also deploy programmatically using the Agent Platform SDK directly. This is useful for CI/CD pipelines or custom deployment workflows:

deploy.py

```python
import vertexai
from my_bq_agent.agent import app

PROJECT_ID = "your-gcp-project-id"
LOCATION = "us-central1"
STAGING_BUCKET = "gs://your-staging-bucket"

vertexai.init(
    project=PROJECT_ID, location=LOCATION, staging_bucket=STAGING_BUCKET

### Troubleshooting

If events are not appearing in your BigQuery table after deployment:

1. **Check ADK version**: Ensure `google-adk>=1.24.0` is in your requirements. Earlier versions do not flush pending events before the serverless runtime suspends the process.

1. **Enable debug logging**: Add the following to the top of your `agent.py` to surface any silent errors:

   ```python
   import logging
   logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)
   logging.getLogger("google_adk").setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
   ```

1. **Check IAM permissions**: The Agent Runtime service account needs `roles/bigquery.dataEditor` on the target table and `roles/bigquery.jobUser` on the project. For **cross-project** logging, also ensure the BigQuery API is enabled in the source project and the service account has `bigquery.tables.updateData` on the destination table.

1. **Verify plugin initialization**: In Cloud Logging, filter by `resource.type="reasoning_engine"` and look for plugin startup messages or error logs.

1. **Use immediate flush for debugging**: Set `batch_size=1` and `batch_flush_interval=0.1` in `BigQueryLoggerConfig` to rule out buffering issues.

## Security: Avoid logging sensitive credentials

Do not log OAuth tokens, API keys, or client secrets

The BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin captures detailed event payloads, including tool arguments, LLM prompts, and authentication-related events (such as HITL credential requests). If your agent uses **authenticated tools** (e.g., `AuthenticatedFunctionTool` with OAuth2), the plugin may log sensitive values such as `client_secret`, `access_token`, or API keys into the `content` column of your BigQuery table.

This is a known concern ([google/adk-python#3845](https://github.com/google/adk-python/issues/3845)) and can lead to credential exposure in your analytics data.

The plugin includes **built-in redaction** that automatically protects common secrets. For additional control, you can layer custom redaction on top.

### Built-in redaction

Supported in ADKPythonJava v1.7.0

The plugin automatically redacts values for the following well-known key names (case-insensitive) wherever they appear in `content` or `attributes` JSON:

`client_secret`, `access_token`, `refresh_token`, `id_token`, `api_key`, `password`

In addition, any state key prefixed with **`temp:`** or **`secret:`** is automatically replaced with `[REDACTED]` in the logged `state_delta`. This means ADK session state stored under the `secret:` scope (such as OAuth tokens cached by credential services) is never persisted in BigQuery.

No configuration required

Built-in redaction is always active for structured attributes and state logging, and applies recursively to nested dictionaries and JSON-encoded strings within attribute values. Custom `content_formatter` runs **first** on raw content, so use it to add masking for secrets that may appear in free-form payloads.

Built-in redaction in Java

The Java plugin redacts the same six key names (case-insensitive) recursively across the assembled `attributes` tree — including session state and state deltas — and any key prefixed with **`temp:`**. Unlike Python, the Java plugin does **not** redact keys prefixed `secret:`; keep secrets out of non-`temp:` state scopes or mask them with a custom `contentFormatter`.

A custom Java `contentFormatter` must be **thread-safe** (it is called concurrently across invocations) and **fast/non-blocking** (it runs on the event-processing path), and it must return a **new object** rather than mutating the content it receives. If it throws, the Java plugin drops the row's content (fail-closed) rather than logging the unformatted payload.

### Use `content_formatter` to redact additional secrets

Provide a custom `content_formatter` function in `BigQueryLoggerConfig` to strip or mask sensitive fields before they are written:

```python
import json
import re
from typing import Any

SENSITIVE_KEYS = {"client_secret", "access_token", "refresh_token", "api_key", "secret"}

def redact_credentials(event_content: Any, event_type: str) -> str:
    """Redact OAuth secrets and tokens from logged content."""
    if isinstance(event_content, dict):
        text = json.dumps(event_content)
    else:
        text = str(event_content)

    for key in SENSITIVE_KEYS:
        # Redact values in JSON-like strings: "client_secret": "GOCSPX-xxx"
        text = re.sub(
            rf'("{key}"\s*:\s*)"[^"]*"',
            rf'\1"[REDACTED]"',
            text,
            flags=re.IGNORECASE,
        )
    return text

config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    content_formatter=redact_credentials,
    # ... other options
)
```

### Use `event_denylist` to skip credential events

If you do not need to log authentication-related events, exclude them entirely:

```python
config = BigQueryLoggerConfig(
    event_denylist=[
        "HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST",
        "HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_COMPLETED",
    ],
    # ... other options
)
```

```java
import com.google.common.collect.ImmutableList;

BigQueryLoggerConfig config = BigQueryLoggerConfig.builder()
    .eventDenylist(ImmutableList.of(
        "HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST",
        "HITL_CREDENTIAL_REQUEST_COMPLETED"
    ))
    // ... other options
    .build();
```

### General best practices

- **Never hardcode secrets** in agent source code. Use environment variables or a secret manager (e.g., Google Cloud Secret Manager) for OAuth client secrets and API keys.
- **Restrict BigQuery table access** using IAM to limit who can read logged event data.
- **Audit your logs** periodically to verify no unexpected sensitive data is being captured.

## Operations

### Tracing and observability

The plugin populates the `trace_id`, `span_id`, and `parent_span_id` columns on every emitted row so the parent-child execution tree (Agent → LLM call / Tool call) reconstructs cleanly from BigQuery.

- **Internal span tracking, no OTel span export.** The plugin tracks the parent-child hierarchy on its own internal stack of 16-hex `span_id` values. The root invocation span reuses the ambient OTel span's id when one is active (so it lines up with the runner's invocation span); child BQAA spans are generated internally. It does **not** call `tracer.start_span(...)` on any configured OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider`, so its instrumentation never reaches your configured exporter — this is what prevents duplicate spans in Cloud Trace when Agent Engine telemetry is enabled (`GOOGLE_CLOUD_AGENT_ENGINE_ENABLE_TELEMETRY=true`) or when you wire any other Cloud Trace exporter into the host process. The Java plugin uses the same internal, ID-only span tracking.
- **`trace_id` inherited from the ambient OTel span when present.** If the surrounding runtime has already started an OTel span — Agent Engine's invocation span, the ADK `Runner` invocation span, or any span you opened before the agent runs — the plugin reads its `trace_id` and stamps it on every BigQuery row. BigQuery rows therefore join cleanly to your existing Cloud Trace traces via a shared `trace_id`.
- **Fallback when no ambient span is present.** If no ambient OTel span is active (e.g. a non-Agent-Engine deployment with no host-side tracer configured), the plugin generates a per-invocation 32-hex `trace_id` (the Java plugin falls back to the ADK invocation ID as the `trace_id`) so the parent-child hierarchy is always preserved in BigQuery, even without any external tracer setup.
- **No `TracerProvider` is required.** Configuring an OpenTelemetry `TracerProvider` in your host process is optional. It only matters if you want the plugin's `trace_id` to be sourced from your own pre-existing ambient span (e.g. to correlate against telemetry from non-ADK services). The plugin no longer needs the provider for its own bookkeeping.

If you relied on the plugin to feed your OTel exporter

Some older configurations used the BQAA plugin as a side channel for OpenTelemetry span emission — that path is intentionally gone. Configure OTel instrumentation in the host application instead (Agent Engine wires this automatically; for local deployments use ADK's own framework instrumentation or an explicit `TracerProvider`). The plugin's BigQuery rows will continue to join to your traces via `trace_id`.

### Public methods

The plugin exposes several public methods for lifecycle management:

- **`await plugin.flush()`**: Flush all pending events to BigQuery. Call this before shutdown to avoid data loss.

- **`await plugin.shutdown(timeout=None)`**: Gracefully shut down the plugin, flushing pending events and releasing resources. The optional `timeout` parameter overrides `shutdown_timeout` from the config.

- **`await plugin.create_analytics_views()`**: Manually (re-)create all per-event-type analytics views. Useful after a schema upgrade or when views need to be refreshed.

- **`plugin.get_drop_stats()`**: Return a snapshot of dropped-event counts per `drop_reason`. See [Dropped-event observability](#dropped-event-observability) below.

- **Async context manager**: The plugin supports `async with` for automatic startup and shutdown:

  ```python
  async with BigQueryAgentAnalyticsPlugin(
      project_id=PROJECT_ID, dataset_id=DATASET_ID
  ) as plugin:
      # plugin is initialized and ready to use
      ...
  # plugin.shutdown() is called automatically on exit
  ```

In Java, the plugin lifecycle is managed via the `close()` method (inherited from `Plugin`), which returns an RxJava `Completable`.

- **`plugin.close()`**: Gracefully shuts down the plugin, flushing pending events and releasing resources (including the BigQuery write client and executors).
- **Automatic Closure**: If you are using `InMemoryRunner`, calling `runner.close()` will automatically close all registered plugins, including the BigQuery Agent Analytics plugin.
- **`plugin.getDropStats()`**: Returns an `ImmutableMap<String, Long>` of dropped-event counts per drop reason. See [Dropped-event observability](#dropped-event-observability).
- **JVM shutdown hook**: The plugin registers a shutdown hook at construction, so pending events are drained (best-effort, bounded by `shutdownTimeout`) at JVM exit even if `close()` is never called. An explicit `close()` deregisters the hook. Still prefer calling `close()` for a deterministic flush.

```java
// Manual shutdown
plugin.close().blockingAwait();
```

### Dropped-event observability

Supported in ADKPythonJava v1.7.0

BigQuery logging is best-effort — events can be dropped when the in-memory queue overflows or when a write ultimately fails. The plugin tracks dropped rows per `drop_reason` and exposes a polling API so a host can detect, alert on, and ship the counts to its own monitoring.

**Drop reasons:**

| Reason                    | Language     | Cause                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `queue_full`              | Python, Java | The in-memory batch queue overflowed (host produces events faster than the drainer can ship). Increase `queue_max_size` / `queueMaxSize` on `BigQueryLoggerConfig`, raise `batch_size` / `batchSize` to drain in larger chunks, or scale the consumer side (more concurrent invocations finishing faster). |
| `arrow_prep_failed`       | Python       | A row could not be converted to its Arrow representation (typically schema/type mismatch). Inspect logs for the offending field.                                                                                                                                                                           |

| `unexpected_error`        | Python       | Any other exception caught while preparing or writing the batch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| `serialization_error`     | Java         | A row could not be serialized for the write stream (typically a schema/type mismatch).

stats = plugin.get_drop_stats()
# Example: {"queue_full": 12, "retry_exhausted": 0, ...}

total_dropped = sum(stats.values())
```

```java
// Snapshot of {drop_reason: count} since plugin start.
ImmutableMap<String, Long> stats = plugin.getDropStats();
// Example: {queue_full=12, append_error=0, serialization_error=0,
//           after_close=0, shutdown_timeout=0, writer_permit_exhausted=0,
//           writer_create_error=0, late_after_finalize=0}

long totalDropped = stats.values().stream().mapToLong(Long::longValue).sum();
```

**Exporting to your monitoring system** — poll periodically and ship the deltas:

```python
import asyncio

async def export_loop(plugin):
    last = {k: 0 for k in (
        "queue_full", "arrow_prep_failed",
        "retry_exhausted", "non_retryable", "unexpected_error",
    )}
    while True:
        current = plugin.get_drop_stats()
        for reason, count in current.items():
            delta = count - last.get(reason, 0)
            if delta:
                # e.g. metric_client.write_point(
                #         metric="bqaa_dropped_events",
                #         labels={"reason": reason}, value=delta)

        last = current
        await asyncio.sleep(60)
```

Any non-zero count means analytics rows were dropped before reaching BigQuery. Alert on every reason; sustained `queue_full` or write-error counts (`retry_exhausted` / `non_retryable` in Python, `append_error` in Java) generally indicate throughput or Storage Write health problems.

### Multiprocessing and fork safety

The plugin is fork-aware: it sets `GRPC_ENABLE_FORK_SUPPORT=1` before loading the gRPC C-core library and registers an `os.register_at_fork` handler that resets inherited runtime state (gRPC channels, write streams, event loops) in child processes. This means the plugin can survive `os.fork()` without leaking file descriptors or sending data on a parent's connection.

However, **`spawn` is the recommended multiprocessing start method** for production deployments. `fork` copies the parent's address space, including any in-flight gRPC state, and the post-fork reset adds latency to the first write in each child. With `spawn`, each worker initializes the plugin cleanly.

For Gunicorn deployments specifically:

- Prefer `--preload` combined with lazy plugin initialization (the plugin defers setup until the first event is logged), or
- Initialize the plugin inside a `post_fork` hook so each worker gets its own client.

Note

The fork-safety mechanism resets runtime state only. It does **not** replay events that were queued but not yet flushed in the parent process at the time of fork. Call `await plugin.flush()` before forking if you need to guarantee delivery.

## Additional ways to consume logged data

### BigQuery Agent Analytics SDK

The [BigQuery Agent Analytics SDK](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/tree/main) provides a programmatic way to consume and analyze the data logged by the plugin. Use the SDK for:

- **Agent evaluation**: Compare agent runs against expected outcomes
- **Golden trajectory matching**: Validate that agent execution paths match approved sequences
- **Trace visualization**: Reconstruct and visualize agent execution flows from logged spans

### Build a dashboard

Visualize your agent's performance data with a ready-made Looker dashboard, or build your own from the example notebook.

#### Looker Block

The [BigQuery Agent Analytics Looker Block](https://marketplace.looker.com/marketplace/detail/agent_analytics) provides a ready-to-use dashboard for monitoring, debugging, and optimizing your agents, with insights into interactions, tool usage, LLM performance, and cost footprints. It surfaces:

- **Aggregate metrics**: token consumption, user engagement, and tool execution volumes.
- **System health**: P50–P99 latency distributions and tool failure tracking to help you pinpoint bottlenecks.
- **Interactive drilldowns**: click a metric to open context-aware visualizations for root-cause analysis.

The block uses a Native Derived Table architecture that parses the logged JSON payloads directly, so no additional data pipelines are required. To get started, install it for free from the Looker Marketplace and point it at your BigQuery project ID, dataset name, and base table name.

#### Custom dashboard from a notebook

The BigQuery Agent Analytics SDK includes an [example Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/BigQuery-Agent-Analytics-SDK/blob/main/examples/dashboard_v2.ipynb) that demonstrates how to query and visualize your agent's performance data. Use it as a starting point to build your own custom dashboards tailored to your BigQuery Agent Analytics dataset. You can also publish the notebook as an interactive dashboard using [Colab Data Apps](https://docs.cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/colab-data-apps).
