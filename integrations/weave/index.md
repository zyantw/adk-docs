# W&B Weave observability for ADK

Supported in ADKPython

[W&B Weave](https://weave-docs.wandb.ai/) provides a powerful platform for logging and visualizing model calls. By integrating Google ADK with Weave, you can track and analyze your agent's performance and behavior using OpenTelemetry (OTEL) traces.

## Prerequisites

1. Sign up for an account at [WandB](https://wandb.ai).
1. Obtain your API key from [WandB Authorize](https://wandb.ai/authorize).
1. Configure your environment with the required API keys:

```bash
export WANDB_API_KEY=<your-wandb-api-key>
export GOOGLE_API_KEY=<your-google-api-key>
```

## Install Dependencies

Ensure you have the necessary packages installed:

```bash
pip install google-adk opentelemetry-sdk opentelemetry-exporter-otlp-proto-http
```

## Sending Traces to Weave

This example demonstrates how to configure OpenTelemetry to send Google ADK traces to Weave.

```python
# math_agent/agent.py

import base64
import os
from opentelemetry.exporter.otlp.proto.http.trace_exporter import OTLPSpanExporter
from opentelemetry.sdk import trace as trace_sdk
from opentelemetry.sdk.trace.export import SimpleSpanProcessor
from opentelemetry import trace

from google.adk.agents import LlmAgent
from google.adk.tools import FunctionTool

from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

# Configure Weave endpoint and authentication
WANDB_BASE_URL = "https://trace.wandb.ai"
PROJECT_ID = "your-entity/your-project"  # e.g., "teamid/projectid"
OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT = f"{WANDB_BASE_URL}/otel/v1/traces"

# Set up authentication
WANDB_API_KEY = os.getenv("WANDB_API_KEY")
AUTH = base64.b64encode(f"api:{WANDB_API_KEY}".encode()).decode()

OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS = {
    "Authorization": f"Basic {AUTH}",
    "project_id": PROJECT_ID,
}

# Create the OTLP span exporter with endpoint and headers
exporter = OTLPSpanExporter(
    endpoint=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT,
    headers=OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_HEADERS,
)

# Create a tracer provider and add the exporter
tracer_provider = trace_sdk.TracerProvider()
tracer_provider.add_span_processor(SimpleSpanProcessor(exporter))

# Set the global tracer provider BEFORE importing/using ADK
trace.set_tracer_provider(tracer_provider)

# Define a simple tool for demonstration
def calculator(a: float, b: float) -> str:
    """Add two numbers and return the result.

    Args:
        a: First number
        b: Second number

    Returns:
        The sum of a and b
    """
    return str(a + b)

calculator_tool = FunctionTool(func=calculator)

# Create an LLM agent
root_agent = LlmAgent(
    name="MathAgent",
    model="gemini-flash-latest",
    instruction=(
        "You are a helpful assistant that can do math. "
        "When asked a math problem, use the calculator tool to solve it."
    ),
    tools=[calculator_tool],
)
```

## View Traces in Weave dashboard

Once the agent runs, all its traces are logged to the corresponding project on [the Weave dashboard](https://wandb.ai/home).

You can view a timeline of calls that your ADK agent made during execution -

## Notes

- **Environment Variables**: Ensure your environment variables are correctly set for both WandB and Google API keys.
- **Project Configuration**: Replace `<your-entity>/<your-project>` with your actual WandB entity and project name.
- **Entity Name**: You can find your entity name by visiting your [WandB dashboard](https://wandb.ai/home) and checking the **Teams** field in the left sidebar.
- **Tracer Provider**: It's critical to set the global tracer provider before using any ADK components to ensure proper tracing.

By following these steps, you can effectively integrate Google ADK with Weave, enabling comprehensive logging and visualization of your AI agents' model calls, tool invocations, and reasoning processes.
