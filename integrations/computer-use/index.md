# Gemini API Computer Use tool for ADK

Supported in ADKPython v1.17.0Preview

The Computer Use Toolset allows an agent to operate a user interface of a computer, such as browsers, to complete tasks. This tool uses a specific Gemini model and the [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) testing tool to control a Chromium browser and can interact with web pages by taking screenshots, clicking, typing, and navigating.

For more information about the computer use model, see Gemini API [Computer use](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs/computer-use) or the Agent Platform API [Computer use](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/computer-use).

Preview release

The Computer Use model and tool is a Preview release. For more information, see the [launch stage descriptions](https://cloud.google.com/products#product-launch-stages).

## Setup

You must install Playwright and its dependencies, including Chromium, to be able to use the Computer Use Toolset.

Recommended: create and activate a Python virtual environment

Create a Python virtual environment:

```shell
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate the Python virtual environment:

```console
.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

```console
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To set up the required software libraries for the Computer Use Toolset:

1. Install Python dependencies:

   ```console
   pip install termcolor==3.1.0
   pip install playwright==1.52.0
   pip install browserbase==1.3.0
   pip install rich
   ```

1. Install the Playwright dependencies, including the Chromium browser:

   ```console
   playwright install-deps chromium
   playwright install chromium
   ```

## Use the tool

Use the Computer Use Toolset by adding it as a tool to your agent. When you configure the tool, you must provide a implementation of the `BaseComputer` class which defines an interface for an agent to use a computer. In the following example, the `PlaywrightComputer` class is defined for this purpose. You can find the code for this implementation in `playwright.py` file of the [computer_use](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/contributing/samples/multimodal/computer_use/playwright.py) agent sample project.

```python
from google.adk import Agent
from google.adk.tools.computer_use.computer_use_toolset import ComputerUseToolset

from .playwright import PlaywrightComputer

root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-2.5-computer-use-preview-10-2025',
    name='hello_world_agent',
    description=(
        'computer use agent that can operate a browser on a computer to finish'
        ' user tasks'
    ),
    instruction='you are a computer use agent',
    tools=[
        ComputerUseToolset(computer=PlaywrightComputer(screen_size=(1280, 936)))
    ],
)
```

For a complete code example, see the [computer_use](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/multimodal/computer_use) agent sample project.
