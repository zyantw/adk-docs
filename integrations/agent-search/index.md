# Agent Search tool for ADK

Supported in ADKPython v0.1.0

The `vertex_ai_search_tool` uses Google Cloud Agent Search, enabling the agent to search across your private, configured data stores (e.g., internal documents, company policies, knowledge bases). This built-in tool requires you to provide the specific data store ID during configuration. For further details of the tool, see [Understanding Grounding with Search](/grounding/grounding_with_search/).

Warning: Single tool per agent limitation

This tool can only be used ***by itself*** within an agent instance. For more information about this limitation and workarounds, see [Limitations for ADK tools](/tools/limitations/#one-tool-one-agent).

## Dynamic configuration

You can create a subclass of `VertexAiSearchTool` and override the `_build_vertex_ai_search_config` method to dynamically configure the search settings based on the conversation context. This approach is useful for implementing features such as per-user data filtering.

The `_build_vertex_ai_search_config` method receives the conversation `readonly_context` as an argument. You can use this context to access state information and adjust the search configuration at runtime.

```python
from google.genai import types
from google.adk.agents.readonly_context import ReadonlyContext
from google.adk.tools import VertexAiSearchTool

class MyVertexAISearchTool(VertexAiSearchTool):
    def _build_vertex_ai_search_config(
        self, readonly_context: ReadonlyContext
    ) -> types.VertexAISearch:
        """Builds the VertexAISearch configuration, adding a user-specific filter."""
        config = super()._build_vertex_ai_search_config(readonly_context)
        if "user_id" in readonly_context.state:
            user_id = readonly_context.state["user_id"]
            config.filter = f'user_id: ANY("{user_id}")'
        return config
```
