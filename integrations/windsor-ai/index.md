# Windsor.ai MCP tool for ADK

Supported in ADKPythonTypeScript

The [Windsor MCP Server](https://github.com/windsor-ai/windsor_mcp) connects your ADK agent to [Windsor.ai](https://windsor.ai/), a data integration platform that unifies marketing, sales, and customer data from 325+ sources. This integration gives your agent the ability to query and analyze cross-channel business data using natural language, without writing SQL or custom scripts.

## Use cases

- **Marketing Performance Analysis**: Analyze campaign performance across channels like Facebook Ads, Google Ads, TikTok Ads, and more. Ask questions like "What campaigns had the best ROAS last month?" and get instant insights.
- **Cross-Channel Reporting**: Generate comprehensive reports combining data from multiple platforms such as GA4, Shopify, Salesforce, and HubSpot to get a unified view of business performance.
- **Budget Optimization**: Identify underperforming campaigns, detect budget inefficiencies, and get AI-driven recommendations for spend allocation across advertising channels.

## Prerequisites

- A [Windsor.ai](https://windsor.ai/) account with connected data sources
- A Windsor.ai API key (obtain from [onboard.windsor.ai](https://onboard.windsor.ai))
