# ZoomInfo MCP tool for ADK

Supported in ADKPythonTypeScript

The [ZoomInfo MCP Server](https://docs.zoominfo.com/docs/connect-to-zoominfo-mcp) connects your ADK agent to the [ZoomInfo](https://www.zoominfo.com/) B2B intelligence platform, giving it access to 100M+ company profiles, 300M+ professional contacts, and go-to-market signals. This integration gives your agent the ability to find prospects, enrich records, surface intent signals, and research accounts using natural language.

## Use cases

- **Prospect Discovery**: Find companies and contacts matching your ICP using filters like industry, location, company size, job title, seniority, and tech stack.
- **Account & Contact Enrichment**: Append verified firmographic and demographic data — revenue, headcount, emails, direct dials, and funding — to existing records inside agent workflows.
- **Go-to-Market Signal Detection**: Surface intent signals, leadership changes, and strategic scoops to reach buyers at the right moment.

## Prerequisites

- Sign up for a [ZoomInfo account](https://www.zoominfo.com/free-trial-contact-sales)
- A ZoomInfo SalesOS or Copilot subscription
