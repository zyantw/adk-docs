# Temporal plugin for ADK

Supported in ADKPython

[Temporal](https://temporal.io) is a general-purpose durable execution platform that makes ADK agents resilient, scalable, and production-ready. LLM calls and tool executions run as Temporal [Activities](https://docs.temporal.io/activities) with automatic retries and recovery. If anything fails, your agent picks up exactly where it left off - no manual session management or external database required.

## Use cases

The Temporal plugin gives your agents:

- **Durable execution**: Never lose progress. If your agent crashes or stalls, Temporal automatically recovers from the last successful step - no manual [session resumption](/runtime/resume/#resume-a-stopped-workflow) required.
- **Built-in retries and rate limiting**: Configurable [retry policies](https://docs.temporal.io/encyclopedia/retry-policies) with backoff, plus mechanisms for handling backpressure from LLM providers.
- **Long-running and ambient agents**: Support for agents and tools that run for hours, days, or indefinitely using blocking awaits.
- **Human-in-the-loop**: Pause execution until a human approves, then resume where you left off. Temporal's [task routing](https://docs.temporal.io/task-routing) scalably routes incoming signals (such as user chats or approvals) to the correct workflow.
- **Observability and debugging**: Inspect every step of your agent's execution, replay workflows deterministically, and pinpoint failures using the [Temporal UI](https://docs.temporal.io/web-ui).

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- A [Gemini API key](https://aistudio.google.com/app/api-keys) (or any [supported model](/agents/models/))
- A running Temporal server ([local dev server](https://docs.temporal.io/cli#start-dev-server), [self-hosted](https://docs.temporal.io/self-hosted-guide), or [Temporal Cloud](https://temporal.io/cloud))
- Temporal Python SDK [1.24.0](https://github.com/temporalio/sdk-python/releases/tag/1.24.0)

Note that as of Temporal Python 1.24.0, this integration is experimental and there may be future breaking changes.

## Installation

Install the Temporal Python SDK along with the google-adk extra:

```bash
pip install "temporalio[google-adk]"
```

## Use with agent

### Basic setup

The integration has two sides: the **workflow side** (where your agent runs) and the **worker side** (which hosts the execution environment).

**1. Define your agent and workflow**

Create an ADK agent and wrap it in a Temporal Workflow. Use `TemporalModel` to route LLM calls through Temporal Activities.

```python
from contextlib import aclosing
from datetime import timedelta
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.runners import InMemoryRunner
from google.genai import types
from temporalio import activity, workflow
from temporalio.common import RetryPolicy
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import TemporalModel
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents.workflow import activity_tool
from temporalio.workflow import ActivityConfig

# A Temporal Activity

@activity.defn
async def get_weather(city: str) -> str:
    """Get current weather for a city."""
    # Your weather API call here
    return f"72°F and sunny in {city}"

# Wrap the activity as an ADK tool.  This tool will get memoized, retried, and timed out.
weather_tool = activity_tool(
    get_weather,
    start_to_close_timeout=timedelta(seconds=30),
    retry_policy=RetryPolicy(maximum_attempts=3),
)

# Use your agent
agent = Agent(
    name="weather_agent",
    model=TemporalModel(
      "gemini-flash-latest",
      activity_config=ActivityConfig(summary="Weather Agent")),
    tools=[weather_tool],
)

# Drop your agent in a Workflow to give it durable execution.

@workflow.defn
class WeatherAgentWorkflow:
    @workflow.run
    async def run(self, user_message: str) -> str:
        # For testing; for production, use Runner()
        runner = InMemoryRunner(agent=agent, app_name="weather_app")
        session = await runner.session_service.create_session(
            user_id="user", app_name="weather_app"
        )
        result = ""
        async with aclosing(runner.run_async(
            user_id="user",
            session_id=session.id,
            new_message=types.Content(
                role="user", parts=[types.Part.from_text(text=user_message)]
            ),
        )) as events:
            async for event in events:
                if event.content and event.content.parts:
                    for part in event.content.parts:
                        if part.text:
                            result = part.text
        return result
```

**2. Configure and start the worker**

Use `GoogleAdkPlugin` to configure the worker to make ADK ready to run in a Workflow on a distributed system:

```python
import asyncio
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.worker import Worker
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import GoogleAdkPlugin

async def main():
    client = await Client.connect(
        "localhost:7233",
        plugins=[GoogleAdkPlugin()]
    )

    worker = Worker(
        client,
        task_queue="my-agent-task-queue",
        workflows=[WeatherAgentWorkflow],
        activities=[get_weather],
    )
    await worker.run()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**3. Start a workflow execution**

```python
import asyncio
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import GoogleAdkPlugin

async def start():
    client = await Client.connect(
        "localhost:7233",
        plugins=[GoogleAdkPlugin()]
    )
    result = await client.execute_workflow(
        WeatherAgentWorkflow.run,
        "What's the weather in San Francisco?",
        id="weather-agent-1",
        task_queue="my-agent-task-queue",
    )
    print(result)

asyncio.run(start())
```

### Using MCP tools

Execute [MCP](/mcp/) tools as Temporal Activities:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool import McpToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StdioConnectionParams
from mcp import StdioServerParameters
from temporalio.client import Client
from temporalio.contrib.google_adk_agents import (
    GoogleAdkPlugin,
    TemporalModel,
    TemporalMcpToolSet,
    TemporalMcpToolSetProvider,
)

# Define a shared factory for your MCP toolset.
# Both the worker (TemporalMcpToolSetProvider) and agent (TemporalMcpToolSet) use it.
def toolset_factory(_):
    return McpToolset(
        connection_params=StdioConnectionParams(
            server_params=StdioServerParameters(
                command="npx",
                args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-filesystem", "/path/to/dir"],
            ),
        ),
    )

# The provider tells the worker how to instantiate the toolset.
toolset_provider = TemporalMcpToolSetProvider("my-tools", toolset_factory)

# Configure the client with the toolset provider
async def main():
    client = await Client.connect(
        "localhost:7233",
        plugins=[GoogleAdkPlugin(toolset_providers=[toolset_provider])]
    )
    # ... start a worker or execute a workflow with this client

# Reference the toolset by name when you declare your Agent (inside a @workflow.run).
# not_in_workflow_toolset lets this agent also run locally with `adk web`.
agent = Agent(
    name="tool_agent",
    model=TemporalModel("gemini-flash-latest"),
    tools=[TemporalMcpToolSet("my-tools", not_in_workflow_toolset=toolset_factory)],
)
```

### Local development with `adk web`

For ease of local development, the Temporal wrappers automatically fall back to direct execution when run outside a Temporal Workflow, so you can use `adk web` and other ADK development commands without a running Temporal server. You won't get the benefits of durable execution in this mode, nor will you be precisely testing the production behavior.

- `TemporalModel` and `activity_tool` work automatically — they detect they're outside a workflow and call the underlying LLM or function directly.
- `TemporalMcpToolSet` requires the `not_in_workflow_toolset` parameter (shown in the MCP example above) so it knows how to instantiate the toolset locally.

## How it works

The plugin ensures your ADK agent runs deterministically inside Temporal Workflow code, and causes inputs and outputs to be serialized and recorded for robust recovery. For example:

- **LLM calls** are executed as Temporal Activities via `TemporalModel`. If a call fails or the worker crashes, Temporal retries or replays from the last successful step, adding resilience and reducing token spend.
- **Non-deterministic operations** like (`time.time()`, `uuid.uuid4()`) are automatically replaced with Temporal's deterministic equivalents (`workflow.now()`, `workflow.uuid4()`) when run in Workflow code (but not Activity code).
- **ADK and Gemini modules** are configured for Temporal's [sandbox](https://docs.temporal.io/develop/python/best-practices/python-sdk-sandbox) environment with automatic passthrough.
- **Pydantic serialization** is configured automatically for ADK's data types.
