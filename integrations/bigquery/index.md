# BigQuery tool for ADK

Supported in ADKPython v1.1.0

These are a set of tools aimed to provide integration with BigQuery, namely:

- **`list_dataset_ids`**: Fetches BigQuery dataset ids present in a GCP project.
- **`get_dataset_info`**: Fetches metadata about a BigQuery dataset.
- **`list_table_ids`**: Fetches table ids present in a BigQuery dataset.
- **`get_table_info`**: Fetches metadata about a BigQuery table.
- **`get_job_info`**: Fetches metadata information about a BigQuery job (slot usage, configuration, statistics, status, etc.).
- **`execute_sql`**: Runs a SQL query in BigQuery and fetch the result.
- **`forecast`**: Runs a BigQuery AI time series forecast using the `AI.FORECAST` function.
- **`analyze_contribution`**: Performs BigQuery ML contribution analysis to understand what drives changes in a metric.
- **`detect_anomalies`**: Trains an ARIMA_PLUS model and detects anomalies in time series data.
- **`ask_data_insights`**: Answers questions about data in BigQuery tables using natural language.
- **`search_catalog`**: Finds BigQuery datasets and tables using natural language semantic search via Dataplex.

They are packaged in the toolset `BigQueryToolset`.

## Authentication

The `BigQueryToolset` supports several authentication mechanisms through `BigQueryCredentialsConfig`.

### Application Default Credentials

You should use this approach for local development and running on Google Cloud services, such as Cloud Run and GKE.

```python
import google.auth
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# Load Application Default Credentials
credentials, project_id = google.auth.default()

# Configure the toolset
credentials_config = BigQueryCredentialsConfig(credentials=credentials)
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(credentials_config=credentials_config)
```

### Service Account

You can explicitly provide a service account file or info.

```python
from google.oauth2 import service_account
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# Load Service Account credentials
credentials = service_account.Credentials.from_service_account_file('path/to/key.json')

# Configure the toolset
credentials_config = BigQueryCredentialsConfig(credentials=credentials)
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(credentials_config=credentials_config)
```

### External Access Token

For applications that need to act on behalf of an end-user, you can pass user credentials directly instantiated from an access token, such as from an OAuth2 flow or an external IDP.

```python
from google.oauth2.credentials import Credentials
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# Assume 'user_token' is obtained via an external OAuth flow
credentials = Credentials(token=user_token)

# Configure the toolset
credentials_config = BigQueryCredentialsConfig(credentials=credentials)
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(credentials_config=credentials_config)
```

### External Auth Providers

If you are integrating with an external authentication provider where the token is managed by the platform, such as Gemini Enterprise, use `external_access_token_key`.

```python
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# The key used to look up the access token in the session state
credentials_config = BigQueryCredentialsConfig(
    external_access_token_key="YOUR_AUTH_ID"
)
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(credentials_config=credentials_config)
```

### Interactive Auth (ADK Web)

When using the `adk web` interface for interactive sessions, you can provide OAuth 2.0 client credentials to trigger a login flow. This mechanism works for both local development and when your ADK agent is deployed to environments like Cloud Run.

```python
from google.adk.tools.bigquery import BigQueryToolset, BigQueryCredentialsConfig

# Provide OAuth 2.0 Client ID and Secret
credentials_config = BigQueryCredentialsConfig(
    client_id="YOUR_CLIENT_ID",
    client_secret="YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET"
)
bigquery_toolset = BigQueryToolset(credentials_config=credentials_config)
```

## Sample Code

The following sample code demonstrates how to use the `BigQueryToolset` in an ADK agent using Application Default Credentials (ADC).
