# Deploy to Agent Runtime

Supported in ADKPythonGo v1.2.0

Google Cloud Agent Platform [Agent Runtime](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/agent-engine/overview) is a set of modular services that help developers scale and govern agents in production. The Agent Runtime runtime enables you to deploy agents in production with end-to-end managed infrastructure so you can focus on creating intelligent and impactful agents. When you deploy an ADK agent to Agent Runtime, your code runs in the *Agent Runtime runtime* environment, which is part of the larger set of agent services provided by the Agent Runtime product.

This guide includes the following deployment paths, which serve different purposes:

- **[Standard deployment](/deploy/agent-runtime/deploy/)**: Follow this standard deployment path if you want to carefully manage deploying an ADK agent to the Agent Runtime runtime. This deployment path uses Cloud Console, ADK command line interface, and provides step-by-step instructions. This path is recommended for users who are already familiar with configuring Google Cloud projects, and users preparing for production deployments.
- **[Agents CLI deployment](/deploy/agent-runtime/agents-cli/)**: Follow this accelerated deployment path to set up a fully configured Google Cloud environment with CI/CD, infrastructure-as-code, and deployment pipelines for your ADK agent. You need a Google Cloud project with billing enabled. Agents CLI in Agent Platform helps you deploy ADK projects quickly and it includes advanced service configurations that extend the core capabilities of the Agent Runtime runtime for more mature use cases.

Agent Runtime service on Google Cloud

Agent Runtime is a paid service and you may incur costs if you go above the no-cost access tier. More information can be found on the [Agent Runtime pricing page](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/pricing#vertex-ai-agent-engine).

## Deployment payload

When you deploy your ADK agent project to Agent Runtime, the following content is uploaded to the service:

- Your ADK agent code
- Any dependencies declared in your ADK agent code

Depending on what programming language you use, additional libraries may be included as explained in the following sections.

The deployment with Python *does not* include the ADK API server or the ADK web user interface libraries. The Agent Runtime service provides the libraries for ADK API server functionality.

The deployment with Go *does* include the dedicated ADK API server.
