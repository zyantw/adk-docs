# TypeScript Quickstart for ADK

This guide shows you how to get up and running with Agent Development Kit for TypeScript. Before you start, make sure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 24.13.0 or later
- Node Package Manager (npm) 11.8.0 or later

## Create an agent project

Create an empty `my-agent` directory for your project:

```text
my-agent/
```

Create this project structure using the command line

```bash
mkdir -p my-agent/
```

```console
mkdir my-agent
```

### Configure project and dependencies

Use the `npm` tool to install and configure dependencies for your project, including the package file, ADK TypeScript main library, and developer tools. Run the following commands from your `my-agent/` directory to create the `package.json` file and install the project dependencies:

```console
cd my-agent/
# initialize a project as an ES module
npm init --yes
npm pkg set type="module"
npm pkg set main="agent.ts"
# install ADK libraries
npm install @google/adk
# install dev tools as a dev dependency
npm install -D @google/adk-devtools
```

### Define the agent code

Create the code for a basic agent, including a simple implementation of an ADK [Function Tool](/tools-custom/function-tools/), called `getCurrentTime`. Create an `agent.ts` file in your project directory and add the following code:

my-agent/agent.ts

```typescript
import {FunctionTool, LlmAgent} from '@google/adk';
import {z} from 'zod';

/* Mock tool implementation */
const getCurrentTime = new FunctionTool({
  name: 'get_current_time',
  description: 'Returns the current time in a specified city.',
  parameters: z.object({
    city: z.string().describe("The name of the city for which to retrieve the current time."),
  }),
  execute: ({city}) => {
    return {status: 'success', report: `The current time in ${city} is 10:30 AM`};
  },
});

export const rootAgent = new LlmAgent({
  name: 'hello_time_agent',
  model: 'gemini-flash-latest',
  description: 'Tells the current time in a specified city.',
  instruction: `You are a helpful assistant that tells the current time in a city.
                Use the 'getCurrentTime' tool for this purpose.`,
  tools: [getCurrentTime],
});
```

### Set your API key

This project uses the Gemini API, which requires an API key. If you don't already have Gemini API key, create a key in Google AI Studio on the [API Keys](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) page.

In a terminal window, write your API key into your `.env` file of your project to set environment variables:

Update: my-agent/.env

```bash
echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
```

Update: my-agent/.env

```console
echo 'GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"' > .env
```

Update: my-agent/.env

```console
echo GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" > .env
```

Using other AI models with ADK

ADK supports the use of many generative AI models. For more information on configuring other models in ADK agents, see [Models & Authentication](/agents/models).

## Run your agent

You can run your ADK agent with the `@google/adk-devtools` library as an interactive command-line interface using the `run` command or the ADK web user interface using the `web` command. Both these options allow you to test and interact with your agent.

### Run with command-line interface

Run your agent with the ADK TypeScript command-line interface tool using the following command:

```console
npx adk run agent.ts
```

### Run with web interface

Run your agent with the ADK web interface using the following command:

```console
npx adk web
```

This command starts a web server with a chat interface for your agent. You can access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`. Select your agent at the upper right corner and type a request.

Caution: ADK Web for development only

ADK Web is ***not meant for use in production deployments***. You should use ADK Web for development and debugging purposes only.

## Next: Build your agent

Now that you have ADK installed and your first agent running, try building your own agent with our build guides:
