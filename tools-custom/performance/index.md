# Increase tool performance with parallel execution

Supported in ADKPython v1.10.0

Starting with Agent Development Kit (ADK) version 1.10.0 for Python, the framework attempts to run any agent-requested [function tools](/tools-custom/function-tools/) in parallel. This behavior can significantly improve the performance and responsiveness of your agents, particularly for agents that rely on multiple external APIs or long-running tasks. For example, if you have 3 tools that each take 2 seconds, by running them in parallel, the total execution time will be closer to 2 seconds, instead of 6 seconds. The ability to run tool functions parallel can improve the performance of your agents, particularly in the following scenarios:

- **Research tasks:** Where the agent collects information from multiple sources before proceeding to the next stage of the workflow.
- **API calls:** Where the agent accesses several APIs independently, such as searching for available flights using APIs from multiple airlines.
- **Publishing and communication tasks:** When the agent needs to publish or communicate through multiple, independent channels or multiple recipients.

However, your custom tools must be built with asynchronous execution support to enable this performance improvement. This guide explains how parallel tool execution works in the ADK and how to build your tools to take full advantage of this processing feature.

Warning

Any ADK Tools that use synchronous processing in a set of tool function calls will block other tools from executing in parallel, even if the other tools allow for parallel execution.

## Build parallel-ready tools

Enable parallel execution of your tool functions by defining them as asynchronous functions. In Python code, this means using `async def` and `await` syntax which allows the ADK to run them concurrently in an `asyncio` event loop. The following sections show examples of agent tools built for parallel processing and asynchronous operations.

### Example of http web call

The following code example show how to modify the `get_weather()` function to operate asynchronously and allow for parallel execution:

```python
 async def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
      async with aiohttp.ClientSession() as session:
          async with session.get(f"http://api.weather.com/{city}") as response:
              return await response.json()
```

### Example of database call

The following code example show how to write a database calling function to operate asynchronously:

```python
async def query_database(query: str) -> list:
      async with asyncpg.connect("postgresql://...") as conn:
          return await conn.fetch(query)
```

### Example of yielding behavior for long loops

In cases where a tool is processing multiple requests or numerous long-running requests, consider adding yielding code to allow other tools to execute, as shown in the following code sample:

```python
async def process_data(data: list) -> dict:
      results = []
      for i, item in enumerate(data):
          processed = await process_item(item)  # Yield point
          results.append(processed)

          # Add periodic yield points for long loops
          if i % 100 == 0:
              await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield control
      return {"results": results}
```

Important

Use the `asyncio.sleep()` function for pauses to avoid blocking execution of other functions.

### Example of thread pools for intensive operations

When performing processing-intensive functions, consider creating thread pools for better management of available computing resources, as shown in the following example:

```python
async def cpu_intensive_tool(data: list) -> dict:
      loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

      # Use thread pool for CPU-bound work
      with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
          result = await loop.run_in_executor(
              executor,
              expensive_computation,
              data
          )
      return {"result": result}
```

### Example of process chunking

When performing processes on long lists or large amounts of data, consider combining a thread pool technique with dividing up processing into chunks of data, and yielding processing time between the chunks, as shown in the following example:

```python
 async def process_large_dataset(dataset: list) -> dict:
      results = []
      chunk_size = 1000

      for i in range(0, len(dataset), chunk_size):
          chunk = dataset[i:i + chunk_size]

          # Process chunk in thread pool
          loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
          with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
              chunk_result = await loop.run_in_executor(
                  executor, process_chunk, chunk
              )

          results.extend(chunk_result)

          # Yield control between chunks
          await asyncio.sleep(0)

      return {"total_processed": len(results), "results": results}
```

## Write parallel-ready prompts and tool descriptions

When building prompts for AI models, consider explicitly specifying or hinting that function calls be made in parallel. The following example of an AI prompt directs the model to use tools in parallel:

```text
When users ask for multiple pieces of information, always call functions in
parallel.

  Examples:
  - "Get weather for London and currency rate USD to EUR" → Call both functions
    simultaneously
  - "Compare cities A and B" → Call get_weather, get_population, get_distance in
    parallel
  - "Analyze multiple stocks" → Call get_stock_price for each stock in parallel

  Always prefer multiple specific function calls over single complex calls.
```

The following example shows a tool function description that hints at more efficient use through parallel execution:

```python
 async def get_weather(city: str) -> dict:
      """Get current weather for a single city.

      This function is optimized for parallel execution - call multiple times for different cities.

      Args:
          city: Name of the city, for example: 'London', 'New York'

      Returns:
          Weather data including temperature, conditions, humidity
      """
      await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate API call
      return {"city": city, "temp": 72, "condition": "sunny"}
```
