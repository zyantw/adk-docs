# Quickstart: Exposing a remote agent via A2A

Supported in ADKPythonExperimental

This quickstart covers the most common starting point for any developer: **"I have an agent. How do I expose it so that other agents can use my agent via A2A?"**. This is crucial for building complex multi-agent systems where different agents need to collaborate and interact.

A2A Python SDK version compatibility

ADK's A2A integration works with both major versions of the A2A SDK (`a2a-sdk` 0.3.x and 1.x.x). The installed A2A SDK version is detected automatically, so no changes to your ADK application code are needed.

Although `a2a-sdk` 0.3.x is supported in compatibility mode, new integrations should target 1.x.x. If your code references `a2a-sdk` types directly (for example, custom executors or hand-constructed `AgentCard` instances), see the [A2A SDK v1.0 migration guide](https://github.com/a2aproject/a2a-python/tree/main/docs/migrations/v1_0) when moving to 1.x.x.

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how you can easily expose an ADK agent so that it can be then consumed by another agent using the A2A Protocol.

There are two main ways to expose an ADK agent via A2A.

- **by using the `to_a2a(root_agent)` function**: use this function if you just want to convert an existing agent to work with A2A, and be able to expose it via a server through `uvicorn`, instead of `adk deploy api_server`. This means that you have tighter control over what you want to expose via `uvicorn` when you want to productionize your agent. Furthermore, the `to_a2a()` function auto-generates an agent card based on your agent code.
- **by creating your own agent card (`agent.json`) and hosting it using `adk api_server --a2a`**: There are two main benefits of using this approach. First, `adk api_server --a2a` works with `adk web`, making it easy to use, debug, and test your agent. Second, with `adk api_server`, you can specify a parent folder with multiple, separate agents. Those agents that have an agent card (`agent.json`), will automatically be usable via A2A by other agents through the same server. However, you will need to create your own agent cards. To create an agent card, you can follow the [A2A Python tutorial](https://a2a-protocol.org/latest/tutorials/python/1-introduction/).

This quickstart will focus on `to_a2a()`, as it is the easiest way to expose your agent and will also autogenerate the agent card behind-the-scenes. If you'd like to use the `adk api_server` approach, you can see it being used in the [A2A Quickstart (Consuming) documentation](https://adk.dev/a2a/quickstart-consuming/index.md).

└────────────────┘
```

The sample consists of :

- **Remote Hello World Agent** (`remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`): This is the agent that you want to expose so that other agents can use it via A2A. It is an agent that handles dice rolling and prime number checking. It becomes exposed using the `to_a2a()` function and is served using `uvicorn`.
- **Root Agent** (`agent.py`): A simple agent that is just calling the remote Hello World agent.

## Exposing the Remote Agent with the `to_a2a(root_agent)` function

You can take an existing agent built using ADK and make it A2A-compatible by simply wrapping it using the `to_a2a()` function. For example, if you have an agent like the following defined in `root_agent`:

```python
# Your agent code here
root_agent = Agent(
    model='gemini-flash-latest',
    name='hello_world_agent',

    <...your agent code...>
)
```

Then you can make it A2A-compatible simply by using `to_a2a(root_agent)`:

```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a

# Make your agent A2A-compatible
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001)
```

The `to_a2a()` function will even auto-generate an agent card in-memory behind-the-scenes by [extracting skills, capabilities, and metadata from ADK agent](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/a2a/utils/agent_card_builder.py), so that the well-known agent card is made available when the agent endpoint is served using `uvicorn`.

You can also provide your own agent card by using the `agent_card` parameter. The value can be an `AgentCard` object or a path to an agent card JSON file.

**Example with an `AgentCard` object:**

```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a
from a2a.types import AgentCard

# Define A2A agent card
my_agent_card = AgentCard(
    name="file_agent",
    url="http://example.com",
    description="Test agent from file",
    version="1.0.0",
    capabilities={},
    skills=[],
    default_input_modes=["text/plain"],
    default_output_modes=["text/plain"],
    supports_authenticated_extended_card=False,
)
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001, agent_card=my_agent_card)
```

**Example with a path to a JSON file:**

```python
from google.adk.a2a.utils.agent_to_a2a import to_a2a

# Load A2A agent card from a file
a2a_app = to_a2a(root_agent, port=8001, agent_card="/path/to/your/agent-card.json")
```

### Under the hood: to_a2a() method

When you call `to_a2a()`, ADK automatically handles several setup steps to expose your agent:

- **A2aAgentExecutor setup:** An `A2aAgentExecutor` acts as the bridge between the A2A protocol and your ADK agent. If you don't provide a custom `Runner`, it automatically creates a default one backed by in-memory services (for artifacts, sessions, memory, and credentials).
- **State Management:** Creates an `InMemoryTaskStore` to track A2A tasks and an `InMemoryPushNotificationConfigStore` for handling push notifications.
- **Request Handling:** Creates a `DefaultRequestHandler` to route incoming A2A HTTP requests to the `A2aAgentExecutor` and the state stores.
- **Starlette App & Agent Card:** Creates a Starlette application. During the startup phase, it either loads your provided Agent Card or automatically builds one from your agent's configuration using an `AgentCardBuilder`. It then mounts all the necessary A2A API routes.

#### Parameters

- **`agent` (required):** The primary ADK agent instance you want to expose via the A2A protocol.
- **`host` (optional):** The host used to build the A2A RPC URL advertised in the generated agent card. Defaults to `"localhost"`.
- **`protocol` (optional):** The protocol used in that same URL. Defaults to `"http"`.
- **`port` (optional):** The port used in that same URL. Defaults to `8000`. `to_a2a()` does not bind a port itself, so this must match the port you actually serve on (see the `uvicorn --port` flag below), or the advertised card will point somewhere unreachable.
- **`push_config_store` (optional):** A custom store implementation for managing A2A push notifications. If not provided, the system defaults to an in-memory store (`InMemoryPushNotificationConfigStore`).
- **`agent_card` (optional):** An `AgentCard` object or a path to a JSON file. If omitted, ADK automatically generates an agent card from your agent's code.
- **`runner` (optional):** A pre-built `Runner`. If omitted, a default runner backed by in-memory services is created.

### Getting the Sample Code

First, make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install google-adk[a2a]
```

You can clone and navigate to the [**a2a_root** sample](https://github.com/google/adk-python/tree/main/contributing/samples/a2a/a2a_root) here:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google/adk-python.git
```

As you'll see, the folder structure is as follows:

```text
a2a_root/
├── remote_a2a/
│   └── hello_world/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── agent.py    # Remote Hello World Agent
├── README.md
└── agent.py            # Root agent
```

#### Root Agent (`a2a_root/agent.py`)

- **`root_agent`**: A `RemoteA2aAgent` that connects to the remote A2A service
- **Agent Card URL**: Points to the well-known agent card endpoint on the remote server

#### Remote Hello World Agent (`a2a_root/remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`)

- **`roll_die(sides: int)`**: Function tool for rolling dice with state management
- **`check_prime(nums: list[int])`**: Async function for prime number checking
- **`root_agent`**: The main agent with comprehensive instructions
- **`a2a_app`**: The A2A application created using `to_a2a()` utility

### Start the Remote A2A Agent server

You can now start the remote agent server, which will host the `a2a_app` within the hello_world agent:

```bash
# Ensure current working directory is adk-python/
# Start the remote agent using uvicorn
uvicorn contributing.samples.a2a.a2a_root.remote_a2a.hello_world.agent:a2a_app --host localhost --port 8001
```

Why use port 8001?

In this quickstart, when testing locally, your agents will be using localhost, so the `port` for the A2A server for the exposed agent (the remote, prime agent) must be different from the consuming agent's port. The default port for `adk web` where you will interact with the consuming agent is `8000`, which is why the A2A server is created using a separate port, `8001`.

Once executed, you should see something like:

```shell
INFO:     Started server process [10615]
INFO:     Waiting for application startup.
INFO:     Application startup complete.
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://localhost:8001 (Press CTRL+C to quit)
```

### Check that your remote agent is running

You can check that your agent is up and running by visiting the agent card that was auto-generated earlier as part of your `to_a2a()` function in `a2a_root/remote_a2a/hello_world/agent.py`:

<http://localhost:8001/.well-known/agent-card.json>

You should see the contents of the agent card, which should look like:

```json
{"capabilities":{},"defaultInputModes":["text/plain"],"defaultOutputModes":["text/plain"],"description":"hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers.","name":"hello_world_agent","protocolVersion":"0.2.6","skills":[{"description":"hello world agent that can roll a dice of 8 sides and check prime numbers. \n      I roll dice and answer questions about the outcome of the dice rolls.\n      I can roll dice of different sizes.\n      I can use multiple tools in parallel by calling functions in parallel(in one request and in one round).\n      It is ok to discuss previous dice roles, and comment on the dice rolls.\n      When I are asked to roll a die, I must call the roll_die tool with the number of sides.

```

### Run the Main (Consuming) Agent

Now that your remote agent is running, you can launch the dev UI and select "a2a_root" as your agent.

```bash
# In a separate terminal, run the adk web server
adk web contributing/samples/a2a/
```

To open the adk web server, go to: <http://localhost:8000>.

## Example Interactions

Once both services are running, you can interact with the root agent to see how it calls the remote agent via A2A:

**Simple Dice Rolling:** This interaction uses a local agent, the Roll Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 6-sided die
Bot: I rolled a 4 for you.
```

**Prime Number Checking:**

This interaction uses a remote agent via A2A, the Prime Agent:

```text
User: Is 7 a prime number?
Bot: Yes, 7 is a prime number.
```

**Combined Operations:**

This interaction uses both the local Roll Agent and the remote Prime Agent:

```text
User: Roll a 10-sided die and check if it's prime
Bot: I rolled an 8 for you.
Bot: 8 is not a prime number.
```

## Advanced Configuration: Custom Converters and Interceptors

In scenarios where you want more granular control than what `to_a2a()` provides, you may instantiate and pass an [`A2aAgentExecutorConfig`](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/a2a/executor/config.py) directly to the `A2aAgentExecutor`. This allows you to override default data converters and inject execution middleware.

### Converters

Converters handle the bidirectional translation between A2A protocol payloads and ADK's native `Event` or `Part` objects. You can provide your own mapping functions for the following hooks:

- **`a2a_part_converter`**: Converts A2A Message Parts into ADK `Part` objects.
- **`gen_ai_part_converter`**: Converts native ADK `Part` objects into A2A Message Parts.
- **`request_converter`**: Converts an incoming A2A request into an ADK `RunRequest`.
- **`event_converter`**: *(Legacy)* Converts an ADK Event into an A2A Event, used by the legacy executor implementation.
- **`adk_event_converter`**: *(New)* Converts an ADK Event into an A2A Event, used by the new, updated executor implementation.

### Execute Interceptors

You can inject a list of `execute_interceptors` to add middleware logic to the `A2aAgentExecutor` payload processing:

- **`before_agent`**: Executed before the agent starts processing the request. It allows you to inspect or modify the incoming `RequestContext`.
- **`after_event`**: Executed *after* an ADK event is converted to an A2A event. Allows you to mutate the outgoing event before it is enqueued, or return `None` to filter out and drop the event entirely.
- **`after_agent`**: Executed after the agent finishes and the final event is prepared. Use this to inspect or modify the terminal status event (e.g., `completed` or `failed`) before it is sent.

Suppress experimental warnings

ADK_SUPPRESS_A2A_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE_WARNINGS environment variable can be set to true to suppress warnings related to experimental A2A features. This is useful for developers who are knowingly using these features and wish to have cleaner logs:

```bash
export ADK_SUPPRESS_A2A_EXPERIMENTAL_FEATURE_WARNINGS=true
```

## Agent Executor V2

The new version of the [agent executor](https://github.com/google/adk-python/blob/main/src/google/adk/a2a/executor/a2a_agent_executor_impl.py) is typically enabled when a client sends the required [A2A extension](https://adk.dev/a2a/a2a-extension/index.md).

However, you can also bypass the extension and force the server to use the new executor version by setting the `force_new_version=True` flag when instantiating the `A2aAgentExecutor`. This allows you to use the new executor logic without needing to modify existing clients to send the extension.

```python
from google.adk.a2a.executor.a2a_agent_executor import A2aAgentExecutor

executor = A2aAgentExecutor(
            ...,
            force_new_version=True
        )
```

## Next Steps

Now that you have created an agent that's exposing a remote agent via an A2A server, the next step is to learn how to consume it from another agent.
