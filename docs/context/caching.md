When working with agents to complete tasks, you may want to reuse extended
instructions or large sets of data across multiple agent requests to a
generative AI model. Resending this data for each agent request is slow,
inefficient, and can be expensive. Using context caching features in generative
AI models can significantly speed up responses and lower the number of tokens
sent to the model for each request.

The ADK Context Caching feature allows you to cache request data with generative
AI models that support it, including Gemini 2.0 and higher models. This document
explains how to configure and use this feature.

## Configure context caching

You configure the context caching feature at ADK `App` object level,
which wraps your agent. Use the `ContextCacheConfig` class to configure
these settings, as shown in the following code sample:

=== "Python"

    ```python
    from google.adk import Agent
    from google.adk.apps.app import App
    from google.adk.agents.context_cache_config import ContextCacheConfig

    root_agent = Agent(
      # configure an agent using Gemini 2.0 or higher
    )

    # Create the app with context caching configuration
    app = App(
        name='my-caching-agent-app',
        root_agent=root_agent,
        context_cache_config=ContextCacheConfig(
            min_tokens=2048,    # Minimum tokens to trigger caching
            ttl_seconds=600,    # Store for up to 10 minutes
            cache_intervals=5,  # Refresh after 5 uses
        ),
    )
    ```

=== "Java"

    ```java
    import com.google.adk.agents.BaseAgent;
    import com.google.adk.agents.ContextCacheConfig;
    import com.google.adk.apps.App;
    import java.time.Duration;

    // Create the app with context caching configuration
    App app = App.builder()
                 .name("my-caching-agent-app")
                 .rootAgent(rootAgent)
                 .contextCacheConfig(
                     new ContextCacheConfig(
                         5, /* cache_intervals (max invocations) */
                         Duration.ofMinutes(10), /* ttl */
                         2048 /* min_tokens */))
                 .build();
    ```

## Configuration settings

The `ContextCacheConfig` class has the following settings that control how
caching works for your agent. When you configure these settings, they apply to
all agents within your app.

-   **`min_tokens`** (int): The minimum number of tokens required in a request
    to enable caching. This setting allows you to avoid the overhead of caching
    for very small requests where the performance benefit would be negligible.
    Defaults to `0`.
-   **`ttl_seconds`** (int): The time-to-live (TTL) for the cache in seconds.
    This setting determines how long the cached content is stored before it is
    refreshed. Defaults to `1800` (30 minutes).
-   **`cache_intervals`** (int): The maximum number of times the same cached
    content can be used before it expires. This setting allows you to
    control how frequently the cache is updated, even if the TTL has not
    expired. Defaults to `10`.

## Next steps

For a full implementation of how to use and test the context caching feature,
see the following sample:

    A code sample that demonstrates how to analyze the performance of context
    caching.

If your use case requires that you provide instructions that are used throughout
a session, consider using the `static_instruction` parameter for an agent, which
allows you to amend the system instructions for a generative model. For more
details, see this sample code:
